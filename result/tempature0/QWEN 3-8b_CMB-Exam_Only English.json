The deficiency of vitamin PP can impair the regeneration of these coenzymes, which are crucial for the oxidation reactions during β-oxidation. Among the steps in β-oxidation, the generation of β-ketoacyl-CoA involves the removal of two hydrogen atoms from the β-carbon, a reaction that requires NAD+ as a coenzyme.

    "Result": "Reasoning process\nThe oxidation of 1 mole of pyruvate to CO2 and H2O in the mitochondria involves several steps: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. However, since the question specifies mitochondrial oxidation, we focus on the complete oxidation of pyruvate through the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain. Pyruvate is first converted to acetyl-CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle. One molecule of pyruvate produces 3 NADH, 1 FADH2, and 1 GTP (equivalent to ATP). The NADH and FADH2 generated are used in the electron transport chain to produce ATP. Each NADH yields approximately 2.5 ATP, and each FADH2 yields approximately 1.5 ATP. Thus, the total ATP yield from one mole of pyruvate is calculated as follows: 3 NADH × 2.5 ATP/NADH = 7.5 ATP, 1 FADH2 × 1.5 ATP/FADH2 = 1.5 ATP, and 1 GTP (ATP) = 1 ATP. Adding these together gives 7.5 + 1.5 + 1 = 10 ATP. However, this calculation assumes that all NADH and FADH2 are oxidized via the electron transport chain. In reality, some NADH may be transported into the mitochondria via different mechanisms, which can slightly alter the ATP yield. Taking into account the standard assumptions for mitochondrial ATP yield, the total ATP generated from the complete oxidation of 1 mole of pyruvate is approximately 12.5 moles of ATP.\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

    "Result": "Reasoning process\nThe patient presents with persistent epigastric distension, nausea, vomiting, chills, and fever, which are suggestive of an acute abdomen. The history of jaundice and infectious hepatitis points toward a biliary or hepatic origin. The physical findings include drowsiness, high fever (39.8℃), hypotension (75/55mmHg), tachycardia (120 bpm), tenderness under the xiphoid process, and liver area percussion pain, all of which are concerning for severe biliary disease. The white blood cell count is markedly elevated (28×10⁹/L) with a high neutrophil percentage, indicating significant infection. Serum amylase is mildly elevated (160 Somogyi units), which is not diagnostic of acute pancreatitis but could be consistent with mild pancreatic involvement. However, the most critical finding is the combination of jaundice, fever, hypotension, and signs of sepsis, which strongly suggests acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis.

Let's evaluate each option:\n\n- **Option A** states that the presence of atrioventricular dissociation supports ventricular tachycardia. This is correct because atrioventricular dissociation is a key feature of ventricular tachycardia, where atrial and ventricular activities are independent.\n- **Option B** mentions that a QRS complex in aVR lead being R-type or RS-type supports ventricular tachycardia. This is also correct as an R or RS morphology in aVR is characteristic of ventricular activation originating from the right ventricle.\n- **Option C** says that if the QRS morphology does not conform to a bundle branch or fascicular block pattern, it supports ventricular tachycardia. This is accurate since such morphology suggests a different origin of the impulse, consistent with ventricular tachycardia.\n- **Option D** indicates that a Vi/Vt ratio less than or equal to 1 supports ventricular tachycardia. This is correct as a lower ratio suggests a more uniform activation pattern typical of ventricular tachycardia.\n\nSince all the options correctly support the diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia, the correct answer is **E: All of the above**.\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\":\"E\"}",

    "Result": "Reasoning process\nFreeze-drying, also known as lyophilization, involves the removal of water from a frozen product under vacuum conditions. This process allows water to sublimate directly from the solid phase (ice) to the gas phase (water vapor), bypassing the liquid phase. This is why the correct statement about freeze-drying would involve sublimation. Option A states that the resulting product has a loose texture and dissolves quickly when water is added, which is accurate because freeze-dried products are porous and have good solubility. Option B is incorrect because freeze-drying is carried out under vacuum, and the resulting product is actually suitable for long-term storage. Option C is incorrect because freeze-drying is carried out below the triple point of water, not above. Option D is incorrect because it describes the process as involving a change from solid to liquid and then to gas, which is not the case in freeze-drying. Option E is incorrect because samples with high viscosity are more difficult to freeze-dry than those with low viscosity.\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",
