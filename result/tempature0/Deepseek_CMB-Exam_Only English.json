This is correct, as EBM integrates individual clinical expertise with the best external evidence, requiring application to the specific patient.\n- Option B: EBM provides a basis for clinical decision-making, with the sole emphasis being on the evidence. This is likely incorrect because EBM emphasizes the integration of three components: best research evidence, clinical expertise, and patient values and preferences.

This is correct, as meta-analysis is just one method of synthesizing evidence, while EBM is a broader approach to clinical practice.\n- Option D: EBM practice does not necessarily reduce medical costs. This is correct, as EBM aims to improve care quality, which may or may not reduce costs.\n- Option E: The evidence from EBM is not static.

This combination of multiple seizure types (including tonic, atonic, and atypical absence), developmental delay, and a specific EEG finding of slow (<2.5 Hz) spike-and-wave complexes is the classic triad for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. West syndrome typically occurs in infancy with infantile spasms and hypsarrhythmia on EEG. Ohtahara syndrome has a very early onset in the neonatal period with a suppression-burst EEG pattern. Dravet syndrome often begins in infancy with febrile seizures. Doose syndrome is characterized by myoclonic-astatic seizures.\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\":\"C\"}",

    "Result": "Reasoning process  \nFatty acid activation involves the conversion of fatty acids to fatty acyl-CoA, a process that occurs in the cytosol, not within the mitochondria. This activation requires ATP and is catalyzed by the enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase. The attachment of CoA increases the molecule's metabolic activity and reduces its water solubility because the long hydrocarbon chain becomes linked to CoA, making it more hydrophobic. Therefore, the statement that it increases water solubility is incorrect, and the statement that it occurs within the mitochondria is also incorrect.

    "Result": "Reasoning process\nThe question asks for the carrier for long-chain fatty acyl-CoA through the inner mitochondrial membrane. Long-chain fatty acids are activated to fatty acyl-CoA in the cytosol. The inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to fatty acyl-CoA. A specific shuttle system is required to transport the fatty acyl group into the mitochondrial matrix for beta-oxidation. In this system, the fatty acyl group is first transferred from CoA to carnitine, forming fatty acylcarnitine. This fatty acylcarnitine is then transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane by a specific translocase. Once inside the matrix, the fatty acyl group is transferred back to CoA, regenerating fatty acyl-CoA.

    "Result": "Reasoning process\nThe problem is about correcting a \"blame culture,\" which typically focuses on finding and punishing individuals for mistakes. The correction should shift focus from blaming individuals to understanding systemic or multiple contributing factors.  \n- Option A says responsibility is primarily not on individuals directly involved, which aligns with moving away from blame culture.  \n- Option B says responsibility lies with an unsound system, which is a core idea in systems thinking instead of blame culture.  \n- Option C says errors have multiple causes (individual, task-related, technical, organizational), which is a broader systemic view.  \n- Option D says personnel do not wish incidents to occur and cannot easily avoid unintended behaviors, which supports not blaming individuals.  \n- Option E says the primary responsible person may not know the consequences, which also argues against punitive individual blame.  \n\nThe most comprehensive and foundational reason for correcting blame culture is that errors usually stem from multiple systemic causes, not just individual failure.

    "Result": "Reasoning process\nSegmentation movements in the small intestine involve the localized contraction and relaxation of intestinal segments. This action does not primarily propel chyme forward (that is the role of peristalsis). Instead, it serves to mix the chyme thoroughly with digestive juices and enzymes, ensuring optimal contact with the intestinal mucosa for absorption. While mixing may indirectly influence hormone release or secretion, the main and direct function is mechanical mixing.\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

    "Result": "Reasoning process\nThe problem describes \"massive bleeding in tympanites.\" Tympanites refers to abdominal distension due to gas or fluid, often associated with conditions like cirrhosis with ascites. \"Massive bleeding\" in this context likely refers to a serious hemorrhage, such as esophageal variceal bleeding, which is a common and dangerous complication of liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), this presentation of bleeding with abdominal distension (from ascites) points to a severe pattern of blood heat forcing blood out of the vessels, combined with water-damp retention. The primary acute treatment goal for massive bleeding due to heat in the blood is to \"clear heat and cool the blood\" to stop the bleeding. \"Activate blood and stop bleeding\" is a common paired method to resolve stasis that can result from bleeding without causing further bleeding. The other choices either focus on deficiency patterns (A, C) which are not the priority for an acute massive bleed, or on promoting diuresis/eliminating water (D, E) without the crucial heat-clearing and blood-cooling actions needed to address the hemorrhage itself. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is the one that directly addresses the bleeding by clearing heat and cooling the blood, while also managing blood stasis.\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

This constellation of symptoms and signs—specifically the muffled heart sounds, enlarged heart on X-ray, low voltage on ECG, and evidence of systemic venous congestion (hepatomegaly, abdominal distension)—is highly suggestive of a pericardial effusion with possible cardiac tamponade. Acute pericarditis (E) often presents with chest pain and a pericardial friction rub, which are absent here. Constrictive pericarditis (A) typically causes chronic symptoms and has a different hemodynamic profile, often with a pericardial knock and no fever.

    "Translated": "There is a Problem: \nA pharmaceutical company has just developed a new drug to increase white blood cells in leukemia patients. Animal experiments have shown that this drug has a good effect on increasing patients' white blood cells and has a safe metabolic process. The pharmaceutical company entrusted Dr. Tian, the head of the hematology department at a provincial hospital, to be responsible for the clinical trial of this drug. Dr. Tian had participated in the development of the drug and believed it was sufficiently safe, so he did not inform the patients taking the drug that it was still in the clinical trial stage. One week after taking the drug, the patients' white blood cells not only failed to increase, but their platelets decreased. Dr. Tian did not want his hard work to go to waste and ignored the suggestions of other doctors, insisting that the patients continue to take the drug. Finally, only after intervention from the vice president in charge of medical services was the use of the drug stopped, fortunately without causing more serious consequences. From the perspective of medical ethics, what is unreasonable is.\nAnd there are 5 choices\nA: Although the pharmaceutical company developed the drug for treating leukemia, this experiment is unethical.\nB: Since animal experiments showed the drug is effective and has a safe metabolic process, conducting the experiment is in line with medical ethics.\nC: The doctor did not inform the patients taking the drug that it was still in the clinical trial stage, violating the principle of informed consent.\nD: After the patients took the drug for one week and experienced no increase in white blood cells but a decrease in platelets, the experiment should have been stopped immediately.\nE: Since no more serious consequences occurred, the experiment is ethical.\nPlease choose a choice based on the questionAt the end of your response, provide your answer in this exact JSON format: \n{\"answer\": \"your_letter_choice\"}\nThe answer must be a single choice and only one English letter (A-Z). You cannot output other letters. You have to output double quotation marks. You have to ouput only one line.",
    "Result": "Reasoning process\nThe scenario describes a clinical trial where ethical violations occurred. First, Dr. Tian did not inform patients that the drug was in the clinical trial stage, which violates the principle of informed consent. Second, when adverse effects (decreased platelets) appeared after one week, Dr. Tian ignored other doctors' suggestions and continued the trial, which violates the principle of beneficence and non-maleficence, as patient safety should come first. The fact that no more serious consequences occurred does not make the experiment ethical.  \n- Option A is plausible because the experiment was unethical, but the reason given (\"although the pharmaceutical company developed the drug for treating leukemia\") is not the main ethical flaw.  \n- Option B is incorrect because animal experiments alone do not justify human trials without informed consent and monitoring for adverse effects.  \n- Option C is correct because it directly identifies the informed consent violation.  \n- Option D is correct because it points out the failure to stop the trial after adverse effects.  \n- Option E is incorrect because lack of serious harm does not make an unethical experiment ethical.  \n\nThe question asks for what is unreasonable from a medical ethics perspective, meaning which choice identifies an unethical aspect. Both C and D are correct, but since the question says \"choose a choice\" and typically expects one best answer, the most direct and clear violation is the lack of informed consent (C). However, if only one choice is allowed, C is a definitive ethical breach, while D is also correct but might be seen as part of patient safety after consent was already violated. Given the options, C is the most fundamental and clearly stated ethical violation.\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\":\"C\"}",

    "Result": "Reasoning process  \nThe problem describes loss of pain sensation below C5 on one side and loss of deep sensation (proprioception, vibration) on the opposite side. This is characteristic of Brown-Séquard syndrome, which results from hemisection of the spinal cord.  \n- In spinal cord hemisection:  \n  - Ipsilateral loss of fine touch, vibration, and proprioception (due to dorsal column damage)  \n  - Ipsilateral motor paralysis below the lesion (corticospinal tract damage)  \n  - Contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation (spinothalamic tract damage, because these fibers cross just anterior to the central canal and ascend on the opposite side)  \nThe given sensory deficits match this pattern: pain loss contralateral to the lesion (but described as \"on one side\" relative to the body), deep sensation loss ipsilateral to the lesion (but described as \"on the opposite side\" relative to the pain loss).  \n- Complete transection (A) would cause bilateral loss of all sensations and motor function below the lesion.  \n- Posterior root (B) would cause ipsilateral loss of all sensation in the dermatome, not a crossed pattern.  \n- Anterior commissure (D) affects crossing spinothalamic tract fibers, causing bilateral loss of pain and temperature at the level(s) of the lesion, but not deep sensation loss on one side.  \n- Posterior horn (E) causes ipsilateral loss of pain and temperature at that segment, not below C5 on one side with contralateral deep sensation loss.  \n\nThus, the lesion is spinal cord hemisection (C).\n\nFinal Answer  \n{\"answer\":\"C\"}",

    "Result": "Reasoning process\nThe question compares the independent samples t-test and the paired t-test when sample sizes are the same. The key difference is that the paired t-test accounts for pairing between observations from the two groups, which reduces the impact of variability between subjects. This pairing effectively removes the subject-to-subject variability from the error term. Therefore, when the data are naturally paired or matched, the paired t-test has greater power to detect a difference because the standard error of the mean difference is typically smaller. This increased power for the same sample size means the paired t-test is generally more efficient in this context.\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Fetal death in utero can be a consequence of a severe abruption, but it is not typically a primary cause. Placental aging is not a standard medical term for a risk factor; the relevant concept is placental insufficiency, which can be associated with vascular diseases.

Let's evaluate each option:\n- A: A flat curve in a glucose tolerance test is characteristic of insulinoma because the tumor causes excessive insulin release, preventing a significant rise in blood glucose. This is correct.\n- B: The fasting test is a standard diagnostic tool for insulinoma, as prolonged fasting can induce hypoglycemic symptoms by revealing the autonomous insulin secretion. This is correct.\n- C: During a fasting test or mixed meal test, a rise in blood insulin by more than 50% is not a standard diagnostic criterion. The diagnosis relies on demonstrating inappropriately high insulin levels during hypoglycemia (e.g., insulin ≥3 μU/mL when blood glucose is <55 mg/dL), not a specific percentage increase. This statement is likely incorrect.\n- D: Hypoglycemia symptoms (like confusion, sweating, palpitations) are the primary clinical features of insulinoma. This is correct.\n- E: Surgical resection is the definitive treatment for insulinoma once diagnosed. This is correct.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect clinical feature is option C.\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\":\"C\"}",

    "Result": "Reasoning process\nThe question asks for an incorrect indication for mechanical ventilation in chronic respiratory failure. In chronic respiratory failure, patients often have chronically elevated PaCO2 (hypercapnia) and compensated respiratory acidosis. Therefore, a specific PaCO2 value alone is not an absolute indication for mechanical ventilation if the patient is alert and stable. A progressive increase in PaCO2 (A) is a concerning trend. Severe hypoxemia unresponsive to oxygen therapy (C) is a clear indication. A very high respiratory rate (D) suggests respiratory muscle fatigue. Complication with pulmonary encephalopathy (E) is a definite indication due to altered mental status. However, a PaCO2 above 80 mmHg (B) in a chronic, stable patient without other acute changes or altered mental status is not by itself an absolute indication for mechanical ventilation, as these patients can be chronically adapted to such levels. Thus, using this value in isolation as an indication would be incorrect.\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

    "Result": "Reasoning process\nUnilateral neglect is a neurological condition typically associated with damage to the right parietal lobe, leading to neglect of the left side of space. Let's evaluate each option:\n- Option A: This describes a visual field deficit (like homonymous hemianopia), not unilateral neglect. Neglect is an attentional disorder, not a primary sensory loss. This is likely incorrect.\n- Option B: This is a correct description. Right hemisphere lesions commonly cause left-sided neglect.\n- Option C: While less common, right-sided neglect can occur with left hemisphere lesions, so this can be true.\n- Option D: Patients with neglect often do not consciously compensate for their deficit, which is a characteristic feature.\n- Option E: This again describes a visual field cut (hemianopia), not the attentional deficit of neglect.\n\nThe question asks for the *incorrect* description. Options A and E both incorrectly describe neglect as a visual field loss rather than an attentional disorder. However, since only one choice must be selected, we need to identify which one is definitively incorrect. Option A is explicitly wrong because neglect is not about recognizing positional relationships due to a visual field defect; it's a failure to attend to or represent one side of space. Option E is also wrong for the same reason. Comparing them, Option A is a more direct mischaracterization as it specifies \"cannot recognize the positional relationships,\" which is not the core problem in neglect. Since the question asks for *the* incorrect description and only one answer is allowed, the most clearly incorrect choice is A, as it confuses neglect with a visual field deficit and impaired spatial recognition.\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

    "Result": "Reasoning process  \nLate-responding tissues are those that show radiation damage months to years after exposure, typically due to damage to the vascular stroma or parenchymal cells with slow turnover. In radiation biology, late-responding tissues include kidney, bone, cartilage, and bone marrow, which have slow cell turnover. The nervous system (especially spinal cord and brain) is also considered a late-responding tissue. However, bone marrow is generally considered an early-responding tissue because its progenitor cells proliferate rapidly and damage manifests within days to weeks after radiation, not months to years.  \n\nFinal Answer  \n{\"answer\":\"E\"}",

    "Result": "Reasoning process\nThe question asks for the M2a-specific chromosomal abnormality. In the French-American-British (FAB) classification of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), M2 refers to AML with maturation. The M2a subtype is specifically associated with the t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation. However, this translocation is not listed among the options. Reviewing the provided choices, t(15;17) is specifically associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML M3), not M2a. The t(9;22) is the Philadelphia chromosome, associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and sometimes acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The t(6;9) is associated with a specific subtype of AML (often with basophilia) but not specifically M2a. The inv(14) and t(11;14) are typically associated with lymphoid malignancies like T-cell or B-cell leukemias/lymphomas. Since the specific t(8;21) for M2a is not an option, and the question asks for the \"M2a-specific\" abnormality from the given list, none seem perfectly correct. However, in some contexts, the t(15;17) is highly specific for M3, and its presence would rule out M2a. The question might be testing the knowledge that t(15;17) is definitively not M2a, but is the specific abnormality for another type. Given the options, if we must choose the one most specifically linked to a defined AML subtype that is not M2a, t(15;17) is the most classic and specific association for AML M3. Since the question is \"The M2a-specific chromosomal abnormality is\" and the correct one (t(8;21)) is not listed, this might be a trick question where the answer is that it's not listed, but we must choose from the options. Re-evaluating, the t(6;9) can be found in AML, sometimes with monocytic features, but is not specific for M2a. Among all, no option is correct for M2a. However, if the question is interpreted as identifying which translocation is characteristically associated with a specific AML subtype (and thus by exclusion, not M2a for the others), the most specific one is t(15;17) for M3. But the question asks for M2a-specific. Perhaps there is a misclassification. In some older or alternative classifications, is any of these linked to M2? The t(9;22) can be seen in AML but is not specific. Given the stark specificity of t(15;17) for M3, it is clearly not M2a. Since the question likely has a typo or expects the known association, and the only FAB-specific association in the list is t(15;17) for M3, the answer cannot be that for M2a. Perhaps the question is wrong, but we must pick the best available. Wait, let's check option B: \"t(6;9) chromosomal rearrangement\". The t(6;9)(p23;q34) is associated with a specific subtype of AML, often with basophilia and FLT3-ITD, and in some classifications, it might be associated with AML with maturation (M2) or AML with granulocytic dysplasia. However, it is not \"M2a-specific\". The truly M2a-specific is t(8;21). Since it's not an option, and the question says \"M2a-specific\", perhaps none are correct. But if we must choose, the most commonly tested specific cytogenetic abnormality for AML in exams is t(15;17) for M3, and it's listed as E. Given the ambiguity, I recall that in some multiple-choice questions, if the specific is not listed, they might expect \"t(15;17)\" as a distractor because it's the most famous one, but it's for M3. Alternatively, perhaps the question has a mistake and meant M3, in which case E is correct. Given the options, E is the only one that is a classic, disease-defining translocation for a specific FAB subtype (M3). Therefore, if the question is asking for the abnormality that is specific to a particular FAB subtype (and by process of elimination, it's the most specific one), the answer would be E. But the question says \"M2a-specific\". This is confusing. Upon second thought, in some resources, the t(6;9) is associated with AML M2 or M4, but not specifically. The t(15;17) is exclusively for M3. Since the question likely has an error, and among the options, the one that is most specific for any AML subtype is t(15;17), and it's a common exam question, I will choose E.\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\":\"E\"}",

Enemas are commonly used in labor to empty the lower bowel, reducing contamination during delivery and potentially enhancing uterine contractions. Contraindications for an enema in labor include conditions where the procedure could cause harm, such as significant vaginal bleeding (suspected placental abruption or placenta previa), ruptured membranes (increased risk of infection), imminent delivery, certain cardiac conditions, or severe hypertension. Let's evaluate each option:\n- A: Cervical dilation of 2cm is early labor, which is typically a suitable time for an enema if indicated.\n- B: Intact membranes (membrane not ruptured) are generally acceptable for an enema; ruptured membranes are often a contraindication due to infection risk, so this condition is suitable.\n- C: No vaginal bleeding is a suitable condition; vaginal bleeding would be a contraindication.\n- D: Moderate pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) could be a contraindication because the stress of an enema might elevate blood pressure further or provoke complications; severe PIH/pre-eclampsia is a clear contraindication, and moderate PIH may also be considered unsuitable.\n- E: Cardiac function class I (no limitation of physical activity) is generally acceptable; significant cardiac disease (class III or IV) would be a contraindication.\n\nAmong these, moderate pregnancy-induced hypertension (Option D) is a condition where an enema is not suitable due to the risk of exacerbating hypertension or causing complications like increased intracranial pressure.\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\":\"D\"}",

She developed symptoms at 31 weeks (bilateral lower limb edema not resolving with rest) and at 34 weeks (headache). Her current blood pressure is significantly elevated at 160/115 mmHg, she has edema, and her quantitative urine protein is 3.5g/24h. According to diagnostic criteria for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, severe preeclampsia is characterized by systolic BP ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥110 mmHg, and proteinuria ≥5g/24h or 3+ on dipstick, along with symptoms such as headache. While her proteinuria is slightly below the 5g threshold, many guidelines consider proteinuria of >3.0g/24h as significant, especially when combined with severe-range hypertension and symptoms. Given the severe-range hypertension, significant proteinuria, and symptoms (headache), the most likely diagnosis is severe preeclampsia. This is distinct from gestational hypertension (which has no proteinuria), mild preeclampsia (which has less severe BP elevation and proteinuria), essential hypertension (as her BP was normal pre-pregnancy), and chronic nephritis (which typically presents earlier and has a different history).\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\":\"E\"}",

    "Result": "Reasoning process\nThe question involves the correct sequence for a bed bath for a patient with lobar pneumonia and high fever on bed rest. The principle is to move from the cleanest areas to the dirtiest areas to prevent the spread of microorganisms. The face and neck are typically cleaned first as they are considered clean areas. The upper limbs and chest/abdomen follow. Then, the patient is turned to clean the back of the neck, back, and buttocks. The perineum is cleaned last because it is the most contaminated area. The sequence should ensure that once an area like the perineum is cleaned, no other body part is cleaned afterward with the same cloth without proper cleaning. Among the options, the sequence that follows this clean-to-dirty principle and maintains logical order (e.g., not cleaning feet before back) is key. Option A follows: Face, neck → upper limbs → chest and abdomen → back of neck → back → buttocks → lower limbs → feet → perineum. This sequence cleans the upper body first, then the back, then the lower limbs and feet, and ends with the perineum, which is correct for infection control.\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

The goal is to compare the proportion of past exposure to a certain factor to determine if there is a correlation. This design, where subjects are selected based on the outcome (disease status) and then past exposure is assessed, is characteristic of a case-control study. Case-control studies are a type of analytical study, as they analyze the relationship between an exposure and an outcome. They are not descriptive (which only describe frequency or distribution), prospective (which follow subjects forward in time), experimental (which involve intervention), or simply a survey study (which is a broad term not specific to this analytical design).\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\":\"D\"}",

    "Result": "Reasoning process\nThe question asks for an adverse reaction that is unrelated to the inhibition of prostaglandin (PG) synthase by antipyretic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory drugs. Aspirin and other NSAIDs work by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX), which is PG synthase, leading to reduced prostaglandin production. This mechanism is directly responsible for several side effects: inhibition of platelet aggregation (due to reduced thromboxane A2), gastric ulcers and bleeding (due to reduced protective prostaglandins in the stomach), and impaired renal function (due to reduced prostaglandins important for renal blood flow). Aspirin-induced asthma is also related to PG synthase inhibition, as it involves a shunting of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes.

    "Result": "Reasoning process\nHemolytic anemia involves increased red blood cell destruction, which stimulates the bone marrow to increase red blood cell production (erythropoiesis). This leads to increased reticulocytes (immature red blood cells) in the peripheral blood, which can appear as polychromatic red blood cells on a blood smear. In severe cases, the bone marrow may release even earlier precursors like nucleated red blood cells. Basophilic stippling can be seen in conditions of accelerated erythropoiesis and in some hemolytic anemias like lead poisoning or thalassemia. Howell-Jolly bodies (nuclear remnants) are present when the spleen is absent or non-functional, which can occur after splenectomy for hemolytic anemias like hereditary spherocytosis. A decreased reticulocyte count is inconsistent with hemolytic anemia because it indicates a poor bone marrow response, whereas in hemolytic anemia the marrow should be compensatory and show increased reticulocytes.\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",
