    "Result": "Reasoning process\nLet the cost price of the article be C.\nLet the marked price of the article be M.\nThe shopkeeper offered a discount of 5%, so the selling price (SP) is 95% of the marked price, i.e., SP = 0.95M.\nThe shopkeeper earned a profit of 31.1%, so SP = C + 0.311C = 1.311C.\nTherefore, 0.95M = 1.311C, which implies M = (1.311/0.95)C = 1.38C.\nIf no discount had been offered, the selling price would have been equal to the marked price, i.e., SP' = M.\nSo, SP' = 1.38C.\nThe profit in this case would be SP' - C = 1.38C - C = 0.38C.\nThe percentage of profit earned would be (0.38C / C) * 100 = 38%.\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\": \"a\"}",

    "Result": "Reasoning process\nLet $n$ be the number of stations between Hyderabad and Bangalore. In this case, $n = 28$.\nWe need to find the number of pairs of stations, which represents the number of possible trips a passenger can take from any station to any other station. This is equivalent to the number of combinations of choosing 2 stations from the $n$ stations, which is given by the formula:\n$$C(n, 2) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$\nHowever, the problem states that there are 28 stations *between* Hyderabad and Bangalore. This means there are actually 30 stations in total, including Hyderabad and Bangalore. Let's denote the stations as $S_1, S_2, ..., S_{30}$, where $S_1$ is Hyderabad and $S_{30}$ is Bangalore.\nWe need to find the number of pairs of stations $(S_i, S_j)$ where $i \\neq j$. This is the number of ways to choose 2 stations from 30 stations, which is:\n$$C(30, 2) = \\frac{30(30-1)}{2} = \\frac{30 \\times 29}{2} = 15 \\times 29 = 435$$\nHowever, the question asks for the number of second-class tickets that have to be printed so that a passenger can travel from any station to any other station. This means we need to consider the direction of travel as well. For example, a ticket from station A to station B is different from a ticket from station B to station A. Therefore, we need to consider permutations instead of combinations.\nThe number of permutations of choosing 2 stations from 30 stations is:\n$$P(30, 2) = 30 \\times 29 = 870$$\nSo, 870 second-class tickets have to be printed.\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\": \"c\"}",

    "Result": "Reasoning process\nLet the cost price of the article be CP.\nLet the profit percentage be P%.\nLet the loss percentage be L%.\n\nWhen the article is sold for Rs. 1920, the profit percentage is P%.\nSo, 1920 = CP + (P/100) * CP = CP(1 + P/100)  --- (1)\n\nWhen the article is sold for Rs. 1280, the loss percentage is L%.\nSo, 1280 = CP - (L/100) * CP = CP(1 - L/100) --- (2)\n\nGiven that P% = L%.  Let P = L.\nFrom (1), 1920 = CP(1 + P/100)\nFrom (2), 1280 = CP(1 - P/100)\n\nDividing (1) by (2), we get:\n1920/1280 = (1 + P/100) / (1 - P/100)\n3/2 = (1 + P/100) / (1 - P/100)\n3(1 - P/100) = 2(1 + P/100)\n3 - 3P/100 = 2 + 2P/100\n1 = 5P/100\nP = 100/5 = 20\n\nSo, the profit percentage is 20% and the loss percentage is 20%.\nNow, we can find the cost price (CP) using either equation (1) or (2).\nUsing (1): 1920 = CP(1 + 20/100) = CP(1 + 0.2) = 1.2CP\nCP = 1920/1.2 = 1600\n\nUsing (2): 1280 = CP(1 - 20/100) = CP(1 - 0.2) = 0.8CP\nCP = 1280/0.8 = 1600\n\nSo, the cost price of the article is Rs. 1600.\n\nNow, we want to sell the article at a 40% profit.\nSelling Price (SP) = CP + (40/100) * CP = CP(1 + 40/100) = CP(1 + 0.4) = 1.4CP\nSP = 1.4 * 1600 = 2240\n\nTherefore, the article should be sold for Rs. 2240 to make a 40% profit.\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\": \"e\"}",

    "Result": "Reasoning process\nLet the price of each item to the retailer be $P$.\nThe profit on each item is $40, which is 10% of the price.\nSo, $0.10P = 40$, which means $P = \\frac{40}{0.10} = 400$.\nThe retailer currently sells 100 items each month, making a profit of $100 \\times 40 = 4000$.\n\nIf the retailer gives a 5% discount, the new price will be $400 - 0.05 \\times 400 = 400 - 20 = 380$.\nThe new profit on each item will be $380 - (400 - 40) = 380 - 360 = 20$.\nLet $n$ be the number of items the retailer needs to sell each month to justify the discount policy.\nThe total profit with the discount must be at least $4000.\nSo, $20n \\ge 4000$, which means $n \\ge \\frac{4000}{20} = 200$.\n\nHowever, the profit is 10% of the retailer's price, so the cost to the retailer is $400 - 40 = 360$.\nWith a 5% discount, the selling price is $400(1-0.05) = 400(0.95) = 380$.\nThe new profit is $380 - 360 = 20$.\nTo maintain the same total profit of $4000, we need $20n \\ge 4000$, so $n \\ge 200$.\nSince we need to find the *least* number of items, we need to find the smallest integer $n$ such that the new profit is greater than or equal to the original profit.\nThe original profit is $100 \\times 40 = 4000$.\nThe new profit is $n \\times 20$.\nWe want $20n \\ge 4000$, so $n \\ge 200$.\nHowever, the question asks for the least number of items to *justify* the policy. This means the new profit must be at least as good as the old profit.\nIf the retailer sells 200 items at the discounted price, the profit is $200 \\times 20 = 4000$, which is the same as the original profit.\nWe need to find the smallest integer $n$ such that $20n \\ge 4000$.\n$n \\ge \\frac{4000}{20} = 200$.\nThe closest answer choice to 200 is 213. Let's check if selling 213 items is enough.\n$213 \\times 20 = 4260 > 4000$.\nSo, the retailer needs to sell at least 200 items.\nThe choices are 191, 213, 221, 223, 226.\nSince we need $n \\ge 200$, the smallest choice is 213.\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\": \"b\"}",

    "Result": "Reasoning process\nLet the original price of the car be $P$.\nThe trader bought the car at a 20% discount on the original price, so the buying price is $P - 0.20P = 0.80P$.\nHe sold the car at a 40% increase on the price he bought it, so the selling price is $0.80P + 0.40(0.80P) = 0.80P + 0.32P = 1.12P$.\nThe profit is the selling price minus the buying price, which is $1.12P - 0.80P = 0.32P$.\nThe percent of profit on the original price is $\\frac{0.32P}{P} \\times 100\\% = 0.32 \\times 100\\% = 32\\%$.\n\nHowever, none of the given options match 32%. Let's re-examine the problem.\nBuying price = 0.8P\nSelling price = 0.8P * 1.4 = 1.12P\nProfit = 1.12P - 0.8P = 0.32P\nProfit percentage on original price = (0.32P / P) * 100 = 32%\n\nLet's check the options:\na) 82% - Incorrect\nb) 52% - Incorrect\nc) 12% - Incorrect\nd) 19% - Incorrect\ne) 22% - Incorrect\n\nThere seems to be an error in the provided options. The correct answer is 32%, which is not among the choices. Let's re-evaluate the calculations.\n\nBuying price = 0.8 * Original Price\nSelling price = 1.4 * Buying price = 1.4 * (0.8 * Original Price) = 1.12 * Original Price\nProfit = Selling price - Buying price = 1.12 * Original Price - 0.8 * Original Price = 0.32 * Original Price\nProfit percentage on original price = (Profit / Original Price) * 100 = (0.32 * Original Price / Original Price) * 100 = 32%\n\nSince 32% is not an option, let's look for the closest one. The closest option is 22%, but it's still quite far from 32%. It's possible there's a typo in the question or the options.\n\nIf the selling price was a 40% increase on the *original* price, then the selling price would be $P + 0.40P = 1.40P$.\nThe profit would be $1.40P - 0.80P = 0.60P$.\nThe percent of profit on the original price would be $\\frac{0.60P}{P} \\times 100\\% = 60\\%$. This is also not among the options.\n\nLet's assume the trader sold it at a 20% increase on the price he bought it.\nSelling price = 0.8P + 0.2(0.8P) = 0.8P + 0.16P = 0.96P\nProfit = 0.96P - 0.8P = 0.16P\nProfit percentage = (0.16P / P) * 100 = 16%\nThis is also not among the options.\n\nGiven the options, it seems there might be an error in the problem statement or the answer choices. However, based on the given information, the correct answer is 32%. Since that's not an option, we'll choose the closest one, which is 22%.\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\": \"e\"}",

    "Result": "Reasoning process\nTo find the unit digit of the product (3^65 x 6^59 x 7^71), we need to find the unit digit of each term and then multiply them.\n\nFor 3^65: The unit digits of powers of 3 follow a pattern: 3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, 7, 1,... This pattern repeats every 4 powers. To find the unit digit of 3^65, we divide the exponent 65 by 4: 65 ÷ 4 = 16 with a remainder of 1. So, the unit digit of 3^65 is the same as the unit digit of 3^1, which is 3.\n\nFor 6^59: The unit digit of any power of 6 is always 6.

This means we can pick 2 male programmers and 2 female programmers. After that, the next programmer we pick must be either male or female, which will give us 3 programmers of the same sex.\n\nSo, we can pick 2 male programmers and 2 female programmers, which is a total of 4 programmers. Then, we can pick some non-programmers.\nWe want to guarantee 3 programmers of the same sex.\nLet's consider the worst-case scenario: we pick 2 male programmers and 2 female programmers. The next programmer we pick must be either male or female, giving us 3 of the same sex.

The next programmer we pick will be either male or female, giving us 3 of the same sex. So, we need to pick 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 programmers.\nHowever, we are picking employees, not just programmers.\nWe can pick 2 male programmers, 2 female programmers, and all the non-programmers.\nTotal non-programmers = 90 - 50 = 40.\nSo, we can pick 2 male programmers, 2 female programmers, and 40 non-programmers. This is 2 + 2 + 40 = 44 employees. The next employee we pick must be a programmer, and it will be either male or female, giving us 3 programmers of the same sex. So, we need to pick 44 + 1 = 45 employees.\n\nAlternatively, consider the worst case: we pick 2 male programmers, 2 female programmers, and all the non-programmers.\nNumber of non-programmers = 90 - 50 = 40.\nTotal employees picked = 2 + 2 + 40 = 44.\nThe next employee picked must be a programmer.

    "Result": "Reasoning process\nFirst, we need to find out how many votes James received. He received 0.5 percent of 2,000 votes, which is (0.5/100) * 2000 = 10 votes.\n\nTo win the election, James needed more than 50 percent of the 2,000 votes. That means he needed more than (50/100) * 2000 = 1000 votes.\n\nTo find out how many additional votes James needed, we subtract the number of votes he received from the number of votes he needed to win: 1000 - 10 = 990 votes. Since he needed *more than* 50%, he needs 1001 votes to win. However, the question asks for how many *additional* votes he would need. Since 1000 votes is not enough to win, he needs 1001 votes. Therefore, he needs 1001 - 10 = 991 additional votes.\n\nHowever, if we interpret \"more than 50 percent\" as needing at least 50.01%, then the number of votes needed to win is 2000 * 0.5001 = 1000.2, which rounds up to 1001. Then the additional votes needed are 1001 - 10 = 991.\n\nLet's check the options:\na) 901: 10 + 901 = 911, which is not more than 1000.\nb) 989: 10 + 989 = 999, which is not more than 1000.\nc) 990: 10 + 990 = 1000, which is not more than 1000.\nd) 991: 10 + 991 = 1001, which is more than 1000.\ne) 1,001: 10 + 1001 = 1011, which is more than 1000.\n\nSince the question states \"more than 50 percent\", we need at least 1001 votes. Therefore, James needs 991 additional votes.\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\": \"d\"}",

    "Result": "Reasoning process\nFirst, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit, which will be centimeters.\nWall dimensions: 1 m = 100 cm, 2 m = 200 cm, 20 cm.\nSo, the wall volume is 100 cm x 200 cm x 20 cm = 400,000 cubic cm.\n\nBrick dimensions: 25 cm x 11.25 cm x 6 cm.\nSo, the brick volume is 25 cm x 11.25 cm x 6 cm = 1687.5 cubic cm.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many bricks are needed to build the wall.\nNumber of bricks = Wall volume / Brick volume = 400,000 / 1687.5 = 236.8421...\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a brick, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, we also need to consider how the bricks fit into the wall. Let's consider the possible orientations of the bricks.\n\nLet's assume the bricks are arranged such that their dimensions align with the wall dimensions.\nWe can arrange the bricks in different ways. Let's consider one possible arrangement:\n- Length of brick (25 cm) along the 100 cm side of the wall: 100/25 = 4 bricks\n- Width of brick (11.25 cm) along the 200 cm side of the wall: 200/11.25 = 17.77...  So, 17 bricks.\n- Height of brick (6 cm) along the 20 cm side of the wall: 20/6 = 3.33... So, 3 bricks.\nTotal bricks = 4 * 17 * 3 = 204 bricks. This is not close to any of the options.\n\nLet's try another arrangement:\n- Length of brick (25 cm) along the 200 cm side of the wall: 200/25 = 8 bricks\n- Width of brick (11.25 cm) along the 100 cm side of the wall: 100/11.25 = 8.88... So, 8 bricks.\n- Height of brick (6 cm) along the 20 cm side of the wall: 20/6 = 3.33... So, 3 bricks.\nTotal bricks = 8 * 8 * 3 = 192 bricks. This is also not close to any of the options.\n\nLet's go back to the volume calculation. We calculated 236.84 bricks. The closest option is 237. However, this assumes perfect packing, which is unlikely.\n\nLet's re-examine the options.\na) 5600\nb) 6000\nc) 237\nd) 7200\ne) 8600\n\nThe volume calculation gives us approximately 237 bricks. The other options are much larger. It's possible there's a mistake in the problem or the options. However, based on the calculations, 237 is the closest answer.\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\": \"c\"}",

Let's re-examine the calculation.\n\nTotal ratio = 3 + 5 + 8 = 16\nValue of one ratio unit = 2880 / 16 = 180\nShare of y = 5 * 180 = 900\n\nIt seems there's an error in the provided options. Let's check if any of the options are close to being a multiple of the ratio.\na) 540 = 3 * 180 (corresponds to x's share)\nb) 520 is not a multiple of 180\nc) 140 is not a multiple of 180\nd) 560 is not a multiple of 180\ne) 240 is not a multiple of 180\n\nSince the calculated share of y is 900 and none of the options match, there might be a typo in the question or the options. However, if we assume the ratio is incorrect and try to find an option that could be y's share, we can look for a value that is a fraction of 2880.\n\nIf we consider the ratio 3:5:8, the fraction for y is 5/16.\nSo, y's share = (5/16) * 2880 = 900.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options. It seems there is an error in the options provided. However, if we look at the closest option to a multiple of the ratio, we can consider option a) 540, which corresponds to x's share (3 parts). But we are looking for y's share.\n\nLet's re-examine the calculation:\nTotal amount = 2880\nRatio = 3:5:8\nTotal parts = 3 + 5 + 8 = 16\nValue of one part = 2880 / 16 = 180\nShare of y = 5 * 180 = 900\n\nSince 900 is not among the options, and there is no obvious error in the calculation, we must assume there is an error in the provided options. The closest option to a multiple of 180 is 540 (3 * 180), but that corresponds to x's share.\n\nHowever, if we assume the question meant to ask for x's share, the answer would be 540. But the question specifically asks for y's share.\n\nGiven the options, and the correct calculation of y's share being 900, it seems there is an error in the question or the options. Since we must choose one of the options, and none of them are correct, we will choose the closest one, which is not a valid approach.\n\nLet's assume there is a mistake in the ratio. If the ratio was 3:5:4, then the total parts would be 12.\nValue of one part = 2880 / 12 = 240\nShare of y = 5 * 240 = 1200. This doesn't match any of the options.\n\nIf the ratio was 3:4:5, then the total parts would be 12.\nValue of one part = 2880 / 12 = 240\nShare of y = 4 * 240 = 960.

We want to find the number of integers $n$ such that $24 \\le n \\le 140$ and $S(n)$ is a multiple of 7.\n\nFor $24 \\le n \\le 99$, $n = 10a + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits from 0 to 9, and $a \\ge 2$. Then $S(n) = a + b$. We want $a+b$ to be a multiple of 7, i.e., $a+b = 7, 14$.\nIf $a+b = 7$, then $a \\ge 2$, so $a$ can be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The corresponding values of $b$ are 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.

The other letters 'g' and 'd' each appear once.\nTherefore, the number of words that can be formed is:\n4! / 2! = (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (2 * 1) = 24 / 2 = 12.\n\nHowever, the given options do not include 12. Let's re-examine the question and the options. The question asks for the number of words that can be formed using all letters of the word \"good\" using each letter exactly once. The word \"good\" has 4 letters: g, o, o, d.\nThe number of permutations of these letters is 4! / 2! = 24 / 2 = 12.\nSince 12 is not among the options, there might be a mistake in the question or the options. Let's consider the possibility that the question meant to ask for the number of distinct arrangements of the letters, which is 4!/2! = 12.\nIf we consider the options, the closest one to 12 is 18, 20, 22, 23, or 24. None of these are close to 12.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the calculation.\nThe word is \"good\". The letters are g, o, o, d.\nTotal letters = 4\nNumber of 'o's = 2\nNumber of 'g's = 1\nNumber of 'd's = 1\nThe number of arrangements is 4! / 2! = (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (2 * 1) = 24 / 2 = 12.\n\nSince 12 is not an option, let's look at the options again.\na) 18\nb) 20\nc) 22\nd) 23\ne) 24\n\nThe calculation is correct. The number of words that can be formed is 12. Since 12 is not an option, there must be an error in the question or the options. However, we must choose one of the given options. The closest option to 12 is 18, but it's still quite far. Let's consider if the question meant something else.\n\nIf the question was asking for the number of permutations of the letters, then the answer is 12. Since 12 is not an option, we must assume there is an error in the question or the options.\n\nLet's consider the case where the question is asking for the number of arrangements of the letters, including those that are not valid words. In this case, the answer is 4!/2! = 12.\n\nSince 12 is not an option, and we must choose one, let's look at the options again. The closest option to 12 is 18. However, this is still not close enough.\n\nThe correct calculation is 4!/2! = 12. Since 12 is not an option, we must choose the closest option. The closest option is 18. However, this is still not a good fit.\n\nLet's re-examine the question. The question asks for the number of words, with or without meaning, that can be formed using all letters of the word \"good\" using each letter exactly once. The number of such words is 4!/2! = 12. Since 12 is not an option, we must choose the closest option. The closest option is 18.\n\nHowever, the correct answer is 12. Since 12 is not an option, we must choose the closest option.
