The question asks about a type of person who can \"die many times,\" which implies a scenario where death is not permanent. Among the choices, option B suggests that cowards die many times before their actual death, implying that they may face multiple near-death experiences or psychological deaths. This interpretation aligns with the idea of repeated failures or fears leading to multiple \"deaths\" in a metaphorical sense. Other options refer to fictional beings (zombies, undead, vampires) or abstract concepts (heroes), which are not universally applicable in real-world contexts. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer based on real-world situations.\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}"

However, this is not accurate. The number of working days in a year is typically determined by statutory holidays and public holidays, which do not necessarily increase or decrease over time. The perception of working more days may be influenced by factors such as changes in work culture, remote work, or shifts in labor practices. Since the question does not specify considering special cases or cultural differences, we should consider the general trend. There is no clear evidence that the number of working days has increased for Californians over time, but there is also no evidence that it has consistently declined. Therefore, the most accurate answer based on real-world situations is that people in California work more days in a year than they used to due to changes in work culture and practices.\n\nFinal Answer\n{\"answer\":\"F\"}\n```\nAnalyze the reasoning process of both answers.

The commonly cited figure in educational psychology is the \"70% rule,\" which suggests that people retain about 70% of what they read. However, this figure is often associated with the \"rule of 70\" or the \"forgetting curve\" proposed by Hermann Ebbinghaus, which refers to the rate at which information is forgotten over time. It is important to note that this figure is not universally accepted and can vary based on factors such as the complexity of the material, individual differences, and the method of learning. In the absence of specific information about these factors, the most widely accepted estimate is that people remember approximately 50% of what they read.

While there are various studies and estimates, the most widely accepted figure in educational psychology is that people remember approximately 50% of what they read.
