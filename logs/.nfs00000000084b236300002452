Response: Reasoning process
Let the cost price (CP) be C and the marked price (MP) be M. With a 5% discount, the selling price (SP) is 0.95M. The profit earned is 31.1% on CP, so SP = 1.311C. Therefore, 0.95M = 1.311C, which gives M/C = 1.311/0.95 = 1.38. If no discount is offered, SP = M = 1.38C, so profit = 1.38C - C = 0.38C. Thus, profit percentage = (0.38C / C) * 100 = 38%. This corresponds to choice a.

Response: The difference between compound interest and simple interest on Rs. 1000 at 14% per annum after 4 years is calculated as follows:

Simple Interest (SI) = (P * R * T) / 100 = (1000 * 14 * 4) / 100 = 560.

Compound Interest (CI) is calculated using the formula A = P * (1 + R/100)^T. Thus, A = 1000 * (1.14)^4 ≈ 1000 * 1.68896016 = 1688.96016, so CI = A - P ≈ 1688.96016 - 1000 = 688.96016.

The difference between CI and SI is approximately 688.96016 - 560 = 128.96016, which rounds to 129.

Among the options, 129 corresponds to choice a.

Response: Reasoning process
The problem requires calculating the number of second-class tickets needed for travel between any two stations. There are 28 stations between Hyderabad and Bangalore, so including Hyderabad and Bangalore, the total number of stations is 30. Since tickets are for travel from any station to any other station and are direction-specific, the number of tickets required is the number of permutations of 2 stations from 30, which is 30 × 29 = 870. This matches choice c.

Response: Reasoning process
The present population is 3888, which increased by 20% per annum for two years. Let the population two years ago be P. After one year, the population becomes P * 1.20, and after two years, it becomes P * (1.20)^2 = P * 1.44. Given that P * 1.44 = 3888, solving for P gives P = 3888 / 1.44 = 2700. Thus, the population two years ago was 2700, which corresponds to choice e.

Response: Reasoning process
The integers s that satisfy -26 < s < 24 are from -25 to 23 inclusive. The number of terms is 23 - (-25) + 1 = 49. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by n/2 * (first term + last term), where n is the number of terms. Thus, sum = (49/2) * (-25 + 23) = (49/2) * (-2) = 49 * (-1) = -49. Alternatively, considering that the sum from -25 to 25 would be zero, but since only up to 23 is included, the missing positive terms 24 and 25 imply a sum of -24 -25 = -49, confirming the result.

Response: The volume of oil pumped from the stationary tank to the truck's tank must equal the volume of the truck's tank. The truck's tank is a cylinder with radius 6 feet and height 10 feet, so its volume is \( \pi \times 6^2 \times 10 = 360\pi \) cubic feet. This volume is removed from the stationary tank, which has a radius of 100 feet. The volume removed from the stationary tank corresponds to a height drop \( \Delta h \), so \( \pi \times 100^2 \times \Delta h = 360\pi \). Simplifying, \( 10000 \Delta h = 360 \), thus \( \Delta h = 360 / 10000 = 0.036 \) feet. This matches choice a.

Response: The restaurant orders 20 more smaller cans (25-ounce) than larger cans (35-ounce). Let \( x \) be the number of larger cans. Then the number of smaller cans is \( x + 20 \). The total volume from both must be equal, so \( 35x = 25(x + 20) \). Solving for \( x \), we get \( 35x = 25x + 500 \), then \( 10x = 500 \), so \( x = 50 \).

The largest integer \(n\) such that \(n^2 \leq 99\) is \(n = 9\), because \(9^2 = 81 \leq 99\) and \(10^2 = 100 > 99\). Verification: for \(n = 9\), \(101 \times 81 = 8181 \leq 10000\); for \(n = 10\), \(101 \times 100 = 10100 > 10000\). Thus, the greatest possible value of \(n\) is 9.

The problem involves work rate where the total work is constant. With 10 people taking 4 days, the total work is calculated as 10 people × 4 days = 40 person-days. Using 5 people, the time required (T) can be found by solving 5 people × T days = 40 person-days, which gives T = 40 / 5 = 8 days. Therefore, it will take 8 days for 5 people to complete the job.

Response: Reasoning process
The population decreases annually by 20%, so each year the population is 80% of the previous year's population. After 3 years, the population is calculated as 8000 × (0.80)^3. First, (0.80)^3 = 0.512. Then, 8000 × 0.512 = 4096. This matches choice b.

Response: Reasoning process
The percentage profit from selling at Rs. 1920 equals the percentage loss from selling at Rs. 1280. Let the cost price be C. Then, the percentage profit is [(1920 - C)/C] * 100 and the percentage loss is [(C - 1280)/C] * 100. Setting them equal gives (1920 - C)/C = (C - 1280)/C. Simplifying, 1920 - C = C - 1280, so 1920 + 1280 = 2C, thus C = 3200/2 = 1600. To achieve a 40% profit, the selling price should be 1.4 * 1600 = 2240. Among the choices, e) 2240 matches.

Response: Reasoning process
To determine the number of zeroes needed to number the buildings from 1 to 1000, consider the occurrences of zero digits in each place (units, tens, hundreds, thousands) across all numbers:
- For units place: Zero appears in numbers that are multiples of 10, from 10 to 1000. There are 100 such numbers, so 100 zeroes.
- For tens place: Zero appears in numbers where the tens digit is zero. For three-digit numbers (100-999), there are 9 hundreds (100-199, ..., 900-999) with 10 numbers each (e.g., 100-109), giving 90 zeroes. For the number 1000, the tens digit is zero, adding 1 zero. Thus, 91 zeroes.
- For hundreds place: Zero appears only in the number 1000, where the hundreds digit is zero, adding 1 zero.
- For thousands place: The thousands digit is only present in 1000, which is 1, not zero, so 0 zeroes.
Total zeroes: 100 (units) + 91 (tens) + 1 (hundreds) = 192.

Response: Reasoning process
To find the time for the train to pass the bridge, the total distance the train must cover is the sum of its own length and the length of the bridge, which is 300 m + 150 m = 450 m. The speed of the train is 45 km/hr. Converting this to meters per second: 45 km/hr * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) = 45 * (1000 / 3600) = 45 * (5 / 18) = 225 / 18 = 12.5 m/s. Time is calculated as distance divided by speed: 450 m / 12.5 m/s = 36 seconds. Thus, the answer is 36 seconds, which corresponds to choice b.

Response: The train's speed is 120 km/hr, and it takes 18 seconds to cross a pole. The length of the train is the distance it covers in this time. First, convert the speed from km/hr to m/s: 120 km/hr = 120 * (1000/3600) = 120 * (5/18) = 600/18 = 100/3 m/s. Then, calculate the distance: (100/3) * 18 = 100 * 6 = 600 meters.

First, convert the speed from km/hr to m/s: 120 km/hr = 120 * (1000/3600) = 120 * (5/18) = 600/18 = 100/3 m/s. Then, calculate the distance: (100/3) * 18 = 100 * 6 = 600 meters. Thus, the length is 600 meters, which corresponds to choice e.

Response: The train is 100 meters long and completely crosses a 300-meter bridge in 45 seconds. To completely cross the bridge, the train must cover the length of the bridge plus its own length, so the total distance is 300 meters + 100 meters = 400 meters. The time taken is 45 seconds. The speed in meters per second is 400 meters / 45 seconds = 80/9 m/s. Converting to kilometers per hour: (80/9) * (18/5) = 32 km/h. This matches choice a.

Response: Reasoning process
The retailer makes a profit of $40 per item, which is 10% of the cost price. Therefore, the cost price per item is $40 / 0.10 = $400. The selling price per item is cost price plus profit, so $400 + $40 = $440. With a 5% discount, the new selling price is 0.95 * $440 = $418. The profit per item after discount is $418 - $400 = $18. The original total profit from selling 100 items is 100 * $40 = $4000. To maintain at least $4000 profit after discount, the number of items needed is $4000 / $18 ≈ 222.222, so at least 223 items must be sold.

Response: Reasoning process
Bookman purchased 55 copies: 10 hardback at $20 each and 45 paperback at $10 each. The total initial value is (10 * $20) + (45 * $10) = $200 + $450 = $650. After selling 14 copies, the remaining value is $460, so the value of the sold books is $650 - $460 = $190. Let H be the number of hardback sold and P be the number of paperback sold. We have H + P = 14 and 20H + 10P = 190. Simplifying the second equation: 2H + P = 19. Substituting H = 14 - P from the first equation: 2(14 - P) + P = 19, which simplifies to 28 - 2P + P = 19, so 28 - P = 19, thus P = 9. Therefore, 9 paperback copies were sold.

Response: Reasoning process
The price of gasoline increases by 25%, so the new price is 1.25 times the original price. The driver wants to spend only 20% more, so the new spending is 1.20 times the original spending. The original spending is price times quantity, so let P be the original price and Q be the original quantity. Thus, original spending S = P * Q. New spending = 1.20 * S = 1.20 * P * Q. New price = 1.25 * P. Let Q' be the new quantity. Then, new spending = new price * new quantity = 1.25 * P * Q'. Set this equal to the desired new spending: 1.25 * P * Q' = 1.20 * P * Q. Divide both sides by P: 1.25 * Q' = 1.20 * Q. Solve for Q': Q' = (1.20 / 1.25) * Q = 0.96 * Q. So, Q' is 96% of Q, meaning the quantity is reduced by 4%.

Response: Reasoning process
Let T be the total number of pieces of art. Since 1/3 of the pieces are displayed, the number of displayed pieces is (1/3)T. The number of pieces not on display is (2/3)T. Given that 1/6 of the displayed pieces are sculptures, the number of sculptures on display is (1/6)*(1/3)T = (1/18)T. The number of paintings on display is (1/3)T - (1/18)T = (5/18)T. Also, 1/3 of the pieces not on display are paintings, so paintings not on display = (1/3)*(2/3)T = (2/9)T. Therefore, sculptures not on display = (2/3)T - (2/9)T = (4/9)T. Given that 1000 sculptures are not on display, (4/9)T = 1000, so T = 1000 * (9/4) = 2250. This matches choice b.

- 50% worked 40 hours: 0.50 * 1000 = 500 workers  
- The rest worked 50 hours: 1000 - 300 - 500 = 200 workers  

For each group:  
- Group 1 (300 workers, 15 hours): Pay per worker = 15 * $5 = $75; total = 300 * $75 = $22,500  
- Group 2 (500 workers, 40 hours): Pay per worker = 40 * $5 = $200; total = 500 * $200 = $100,000  
- Group 3 (200 workers, 50 hours): Pay per worker = (40 * $5) + (10 * $7.50) = $200 + $75 = $275; total = 200 * $275 = $55,000  

Total payroll = $22,500 + $100,000 + $55,000 = $177,500, which corresponds to choice d.

Response: Reasoning process
The problem states that the corporation doubles its annual bonus for 100 employees. When a bonus is doubled, the new bonus is twice the original bonus. The increase is the difference between the new bonus and the original bonus, which equals the original bonus. Therefore, the increase as a percentage of the new bonus is calculated as (increase / new bonus) * 100% = (original bonus / 2 * original bonus) * 100% = 50%. The number of employees (100) does not affect this percentage calculation, as it is per employee.

Prompt: There is a Problem: 
a and b together do a work in 20 days. b and c together in 15 days and c and a ...
Response: ### Reasoning process
The problem involves finding the time it takes for b alone to complete the work given the combined rates of a and b, b and c, and c and a. Let the work rates of a, b, and c be A, B, and C units per day, respectively, and assume the total work is 1 unit.

From the problem:
- a and b together complete the work in 20 days, so A + B = 1/20.
- b and c together complete the work in 15 days, so B + C = 1/15.
- c and a together complete the work in 12 days, so C + A = 1/12.

Adding all three equations:
(A + B) + (B + C) + (C + A) = 1/20 + 1/15 + 1/12  
2A + 2B + 2C = (3/60) + (4/60) + (5/60) = 12/60 = 1/5  
Thus, A + B + C = 1/10.

To find B, subtract the equation for C + A from the combined rate:
B = (A + B + C) - (C + A) = 1/10 - 1/12 = (6/60 - 5/60) = 1/60.

Therefore, b's work rate is 1/60 per day, meaning b alone can finish the work in 60 days. This matches choice b.

Response: Reasoning process
The problem states that 30% of x equals 50% of y, which can be written as 0.3x = 0.5y. Solving for the ratio, we get x/y = 0.5/0.3 = 5/3, meaning x:y = 5:3. However, this ratio is not directly listed in the choices. Looking at the options, choice b) 3:5 corresponds to y:x, which is the inverse of x:y = 5:3. Given that the problem asks for the "ratio between x and y" and considering the available choices, b) 3:5 is the only one that matches the relationship derived from the equation when interpreted as y:x. The duplicate option e) 4:5 is likely a typo and does not affect the reasoning.

Response: Reasoning process
The problem involves finding the area covered by three layers of wallpaper. The total area covered by all wallpapers without overlap is 300 square meters. After overlapping, the net area covered is 180 square meters. The area covered by exactly two layers is 34 square meters. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets, let S be the total area without overlap (300 m²), N be the net area after overlap (180 m²), D be the area covered by exactly two layers (34 m²), and T be the area covered by three layers. The formula for the union of three sets is: N = S - P + T, where P is the sum of pairwise intersections. Also, P = 3T + D. Substituting the values: 180 = 300 - P + T, so P = 120 + T. Then, 120 + T = 3T + 34, which simplifies to 86 = 2T, so T = 43 square meters.

Response: Reasoning process
The problem requires selecting 6 managers from 9, with the constraint that two specific managers cannot attend together. The total number of ways to select 6 managers from 9 without restrictions is C(9,6) = 84. The number of ways where both conflicting managers are selected is C(7,4) = 35, as we choose the remaining 4 from the other 7 managers. Thus, the number of valid selections is 84 - 35 = 49. Alternatively, considering cases: if neither conflicting manager is selected, C(7,6) = 7 ways; if exactly one is selected, there are 2 choices for which one and C(7,5) = 21 ways for the others, giving 2 * 21 = 42 ways. Total is 7 + 42 = 49. This matches choice e.

Response: The trader bought the car at a 20% discount on the original price, so the buying price is 80% of the original price, or 0.8P where P is the original price. He then sold it at a 40% increase on the buying price, so the selling price is 1.4 times the buying price, which is 1.4 * 0.8P = 1.12P.

Response: The unit digit of a product depends only on the unit digits of the factors. For \(3^{65}\), the unit digit cycles every 4 powers: 3, 9, 7, 1. Since \(65 \mod 4 = 1\), the unit digit is 3. For \(6^{59}\), any power of 6 has a unit digit of 6. For \(7^{71}\), the unit digit cycles every 4 powers: 7, 9, 3, 1. Since \(71 \mod 4 = 3\), the unit digit is 3. Multiplying the unit digits: \(3 \times 6 \times 3 = 54\), which has a unit digit of 4. Thus, the unit digit of the product is 4, which corresponds to choice e.

The unit digit of a product depends only on the unit digits of the factors. For \(3^{65}\), the unit digit cycles every 4 powers: 3, 9, 7, 1. Since \(65 \mod 4 = 1\), the unit digit is 3. For \(6^{59}\), any power of 6 has a unit digit of 6. For \(7^{71}\), the unit digit cycles every 4 powers: 7, 9, 3, 1. Since \(71 \mod 4 = 3\), the unit digit is 3. Multiplying the unit digits: \(3 \times 6 \times 3 = 54\), which has a unit digit of 4. Thus, the unit digit of the product is 4, which corresponds to choice e.

Response: Reasoning process
The problem states that 50% of the members are women, and 30% of those women are lawyers. To find the probability that a randomly selected member is a woman lawyer, multiply the probability of being a woman (0.50) by the probability that a woman is a lawyer (0.30). Thus, 0.50 * 0.30 = 0.15. This corresponds to choice e.
