Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the item is wrapped in bubble wrap. Bubble wrap is primarily used to protect items from damage during transit or handling, which is typically necessary for fragile items that can break easily. While small items might sometimes be wrapped, size alone is not the primary reason for using bubble wrap; fragility is the key factor that necessitates protective packaging. Therefore, Choice 1 ("It is very fragile") is the most appropriate cause based on the premise.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise "I emptied my pocket" implies that the contents of the pocket are revealed. Without any additional context, the most appropriate and common item one might find in a pocket is a ticket stub, as it is a neutral and everyday object. Finding a weapon is less typical and would require specific circumstances not indicated by the premise alone. Therefore, Choice 1 is more appropriate based on general common sense.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that termites invaded the house, which implies their presence and typical behavior. Termites are known for consuming wood, as they feed on cellulose-based materials. Therefore, the most direct and logical effect is that they would eat through the wood in the house. Choice 1, where termites disappear, is not a typical consequence of invasion and would require an external factor, which is not indicated in the premise.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that a passenger arrives at the border. In typical border control scenarios, the standard procedure involves checking travel documents, such as passports, to verify identity and ensure compliance with entry requirements. This is a routine action that occurs upon arrival at any border checkpoint. Choice 1, "The patrol checked their passports," aligns with this common practice. Choice 2, "Patrol officers accused them of smuggling," implies a specific and negative outcome that would require additional evidence or suspicion, which is not indicated in the premise. Therefore, based on the given information, Choice 1 is the most appropriate effect.

The premise states that the girl was exhausted. Exhaustion typically results from physical exertion. Playing checkers is a sedentary mental game that is unlikely to cause physical exhaustion, whereas skipping the rope (jumping rope) is a vigorous physical activity that often leads to tiredness and exhaustion.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that there is no place for the woman to line up, meaning she cannot find a spot to join the queue. Choice 1, "More and more people began to line up," directly explains why there might be no space available, as an increase in people would crowd the line. Choice 2, "She walked out of the team," describes an action where she voluntarily left the line, which does not necessarily cause there to be no place for her; in fact, it might free up space. Therefore, Choice 1 is the most appropriate cause.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that "the girl squeezed her nose," which is typically a reaction to an unpleasant odor. Between the two choices, Choice 1 (the baby drools on the bib) involves drooling, which may be messy but does not usually produce a strong smell that would cause someone to squeeze their nose. Choice 2 (the baby soiled his diaper) refers to a soiled diaper, which is commonly associated with a foul odor due to bowel movements. This odor is a more plausible cause for the girl's action of squeezing her nose to block the smell. Therefore, Choice 2 is the most appropriate cause.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the man bumped his head, which is an action that typically results in physical consequences. A concussion is a common medical condition that can occur after head trauma, such as bumping one's head. In contrast, being "lost in thought" is a mental state that is not directly caused by physical impact but could potentially be a cause of absent-mindedness leading to an accident. However, since the premise is given as the cause, the effect should be a result of the action. Therefore, Choice 2 ("He had a concussion") is the most appropriate effect based on common sense and logical reasoning.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that "My check was declined," which typically occurs due to insufficient funds in the bank account. Choice 1, "My bank account is empty," directly explains this cause, as an empty account would lead to a declined check. Choice 2, "I got a raise," implies an increase in income, which should positively affect the bank balance and make a declined check less likely, so it is not an appropriate cause. Therefore, Choice 1 is the most logical and appropriate based on the premise.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the man's email inbox was flooded with spam, meaning he received a large amount of unwanted emails. A natural and common reaction to such a situation is to delete the spam to clean up the inbox and reduce clutter. Choice 1, "He deleted the spam," directly aligns with this typical response. Choice 2, "He sent mass emails," is not logically connected to receiving spam; sending emails would be an active action unrelated to the passive event of being flooded with spam. Therefore, Choice 1 is the most appropriate effect.

Response: Reasoning process
Quarantine is typically imposed on individuals who have been exposed to a contagious disease to prevent potential spread, as they may be incubating the illness but not yet showing symptoms. If a sailor was quarantined, it is most likely due to exposure rather than recovery, as recovery implies that the illness has passed and the person is no longer contagious, thus not requiring quarantine. Therefore, Choice 1 ("He was exposed to this disease") is the most appropriate cause based on the premise.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the girl remembered the password. Choice 1, "She memorized it to herself," directly implies an action that would lead to remembering the password, as memorization is a conscious effort to commit information to memory. Choice 2, "She forgot to write it down," suggests a failure to record the password, which might necessitate relying on memory but does not guarantee remembering; in fact, it could increase the risk of forgetting. Since the premise confirms that she remembered, Choice 1 is the most appropriate cause as it actively explains the outcome.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states "I poured water into the glass," which describes an action directly affecting the glass. Pouring water into a glass typically causes the glass to become full, as water is added to it. This is a direct and immediate effect of the action. Choice 1, "This quenched my thirst," implies that the water was consumed, but the premise only mentions pouring, not drinking. Therefore, quenching thirst is not a direct result of pouring alone and requires an additional step not stated in the premise. Thus, Choice 2 is the most appropriate based on the given information.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the man remained silent after his friend finished speaking. Silence in this context is most commonly associated with processing or reflecting on what was just said, rather than an immediate action to support. Choice 1, which suggests he wants to support his friends, is less directly supported by the premise, as support might typically involve verbal affirmation or action, not silence. Choice 2, indicating he was thinking about what his friend said, aligns with typical human behavior where silence follows speech to allow for consideration and thought. Therefore, Choice 2 is the most appropriate based on the premise.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the accident was the speaker's fault. This admission of responsibility typically leads to feelings of guilt or remorse, as the speaker acknowledges their role in causing the accident. Choice 1, "I feel guilty," directly aligns with this emotional response. In contrast, Choice 2, "I sued," implies legal action against another party, which would be inconsistent with the premise that the speaker is at fault; if the speaker is at fault, they are more likely to be sued rather than to sue someone else. Therefore, Choice 1 is the most appropriate effect.

The premise states that "the chain broke," which means the chain has sustained damage or has been severed. The question asks for the cause of this break. Choice 1, "The chain is wrapped around the tire," describes a situation that could cause the chain to break due to tension, stress, or entanglement, making it a plausible cause. Choice 2, "A section of the chain is broken," is essentially a restatement of the premise itself, describing the effect rather than the cause. Therefore, Choice 1 is the most appropriate as it provides a reason for the break.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that "the man's eyes were crying," which means tears were produced, likely due to emotional distress or physical irritation. Choice 1, "His eyes went dark," could imply a sudden loss of vision or emotional shock, which might cause crying as a response to pain, fear, or sadness. For instance, if his eyes went dark due to an injury or intense emotion, it could lead to tearing. Choice 2, "He put on goggles," typically involves a voluntary action for protection against irritants like wind or water, which would prevent crying rather than cause it. While goggles might cause discomfort if ill-fitting, this is less direct and less common than the emotional or physical response suggested by eyes going dark. Therefore, Choice 1 is the most appropriate cause.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that a player has won five consecutive games, which is a notable winning streak. In competitive contexts, such success can often lead to suspicion or envy from opponents, making accusations of cheating a plausible reaction. Conversely, feeling sorry for someone who is winning consistently is illogical, as sympathy is typically reserved for those experiencing loss or difficulty. Therefore, Choice 1 is more appropriate based on the premise.

Response: Reasoning process
Tearing up a test paper is a drastic action that typically indicates a response to serious misconduct, such as cheating, rather than merely incorrect answers. If a student's answer is wrong, a teacher would usually mark it as incorrect or provide feedback, but destroying the paper is disproportionate and unprofessional. Catching a student cheating, however, justifies immediate punitive measures like tearing up the paper to invalidate the work and discourage dishonesty. Therefore, Choice 1 is the most appropriate cause based on the premise.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states "I stopped talking," which implies a cessation of speech. Choice 1, "I lost my voice," directly causes an inability to speak, as losing one's voice means no sound can be produced. This is a common and definitive reason for stopping talking. Choice 2, "I was out of breath," might cause a temporary pause in speech to catch breath, but it does not necessarily lead to a complete stop, as people often resume talking after breathing. Therefore, Choice 1 is the most appropriate cause based on the premise.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the frozen food is thawed, meaning it has been defrosted. Choice 1, putting it in the microwave, is a common and effective method for thawing frozen food, as microwaves generate heat that accelerates the thawing process. Choice 2, covering it with plastic wrap, is often used to retain moisture or prevent splattering during microwaving, but by itself, it does not cause thawing; it is more related to food preparation or storage rather than directly inducing thawing. Therefore, Choice 1 is the most appropriate cause for the thawed state.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the employee is pretending to be sick, which means the illness is not genuine. Choice 1, "He has stomach cramps," suggests a real medical issue, which contradicts the idea of pretending. If he actually had stomach cramps, he would be sick and not need to pretend. Therefore, Choice 1 cannot be the cause of pretending. Choice 2, "He wants to take a day off," aligns with common motives for feigning illness, as employees often pretend to be sick to avoid work without a valid reason. Thus, Choice 2 is the most appropriate cause for the pretense.

Response: Reasoning process
Blisters on the hand are typically caused by friction or physical exertion that involves gripping or rubbing against a rough surface. Typing a letter involves minimal friction and is unlikely to cause blisters, as it primarily involves light finger movements on a smooth keyboard. In contrast, climbing a rope requires a tight grip on a rough surface, which generates significant friction and often leads to blisters on the hands. Therefore, Choice 2 is the most appropriate cause based on the premise.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the warring nations demand peace, indicating a desire to end the conflict. Developing nuclear weapons (Choice 1) is typically associated with escalation or deterrence, which does not directly align with demanding peace and could potentially undermine peace efforts. In contrast, agreeing on a treaty (Choice 2) is a direct and common method for achieving peace, as it involves formal negotiations and agreements to cease hostilities. Therefore, Choice 2 is the most appropriate effect based on the premise.

Response: Reasoning process
Sleeping pills are medications primarily used to induce sleep or cause drowsiness. A common effect is lethargy, which means feeling sluggish or lacking energy. Fever is not a typical effect of sleeping pills; it is usually associated with infections or adverse reactions, which are not implied in the premise. Therefore, based on the premise, the most appropriate effect is that he became lethargic.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that "The woman bumped into the sofa." This action typically involves a person colliding with a stationary object, which is likely to result in injury to the person, such as bruising or pain, rather than damage to the object. Sofas are generally sturdy and not easily damaged by a bump, whereas human skin and bones are more susceptible to injury from impact. Therefore, Choice 2 ("She bruised her knee") is the most direct and plausible effect of the action described.

Response: Reasoning process
When a boy squeezes a balloon, the action involves applying pressure to the balloon. Balloons are typically made of elastic material and can burst if squeezed too hard, especially if they are overinflated or have weak spots. This is a common outcome in everyday scenarios. The option of the balloon flying away is less directly connected to squeezing, as flying away usually implies release or the presence of helium, which isn't specified in the premise. Therefore, the most appropriate effect based on the premise is that the balloon bursts.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise "I bit a peach" describes an action performed on a peach, which is a juicy fruit. Biting into a peach typically causes the juice to be released due to the rupture of the fruit's flesh and skin. This is a direct and common effect. While biting might cause some damage to the peach, describing it as "broken" is less precise and could imply a more severe state than what biting alone accomplishes. Therefore, the most appropriate effect is that the juice spilled out.

The premise states that "My hands are sticky," which suggests a direct cause related to handling something sticky or sugary. Choice 1, "I ate donuts," is a direct action that could result in sticky hands, as donuts often have sugary coatings or fillings that can transfer to hands during consumption. Choice 2, "I love sweets," is a preference or emotion that does not directly cause sticky hands; it might indirectly lead to eating sweets, but it is not the immediate cause. Therefore, Choice 1 is the most appropriate cause based on the premise.

The premise states "I pushed the door," which implies an action intended to open the door. In typical scenarios, pushing a door results in it opening unless there is an obstruction or it is locked. However, the premise does not provide any information suggesting that the door is locked or unable to open. Therefore, the most appropriate effect based on common sense and the action described is that the door opened. Choice 2, "The door is locked," describes a state rather than a direct effect of pushing, and it is not necessarily caused by the action of pushing.

The premise states that radicals boycotted the products. Radicals are often motivated by ethical concerns, such as human rights violations. Choice 2, which indicates that the products are made by child labor, is a plausible cause for boycott because child labor is widely condemned and aligns with the ethical issues that radicals might protest against. In contrast, Choice 1, where the product passed the quality assurance test, is a positive attribute and unlikely to be a reason for boycott; it might even encourage product support. Therefore, Choice 2 is the most appropriate cause.

Response: Reasoning process
When drilling a hole in a wall, the immediate and common effect is the generation of dust due to the friction and material removal from the wall surface. Walls are typically made of materials like drywall, plaster, or brick, which produce dust when drilled. This dust often blows out or is expelled during the drilling process. In contrast, while mice may inhabit walls, they are not likely to crawl out immediately upon drilling a hole, as the hole is small and drilling might disturb them but not necessarily cause an immediate exit. Therefore, Choice 2 is the most appropriate based on typical cause and effect.

Envy typically arises when one person desires a positive attribute or situation that another person possesses, such as happiness, success, or good fortune. In this case, the woman envying her sister suggests that the sister has something desirable. Choice 1, "Her sister is very happy," aligns with this, as happiness is a common reason for envy. Choice 2, "Her sister is divorced," involves a negative life event that is not typically enviable; instead, it might evoke pity or sympathy.

Choice 1, where the customer rummaged through his wallet, indicates a search for money but does not directly result in the cashier opening the register, as no money has been exchanged yet. Choice 2, where the customer handed over the money, directly causes the cashier to open the cash register to complete the transaction, such as storing the money or giving change. Therefore, Choice 2 is the most appropriate cause.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that street musicians attracted a group of people, which implies that the performance was engaging and drew a crowd. In typical scenarios, when a street musician attracts an audience, it is because the performance is enjoyable, and the audience may show appreciation by giving money, such as change. Choice 1 (People gave him change) aligns with this positive outcome. Choice 2 (He drove the crowd away) contradicts the premise, as attracting people suggests a successful initial draw, not a repulsion. Therefore, Choice 1 is the most appropriate effect based on the premise.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the little boy cried to his nanny, indicating an emotional distress. Without additional context, common scenarios suggest that children often cry due to emotional reasons such as missing their parents, especially when under the care of a nanny. While hunger or snack time could cause fussiness, crying is more typically associated with emotional upset. Therefore, Choice 1 ("He missed his parents") is the most appropriate cause based on the premise.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the pilot's radar spotted a storm. In aviation, radar is used to detect hazardous weather conditions, and pilots are trained to avoid storms for safety reasons. Avoiding storms minimizes risks such as turbulence, lightning, and potential damage to the aircraft. Therefore, the most logical and appropriate effect is that the pilot avoided the storm, as indicated in Choice 1. Choice 2, flying through the storm, is generally not advisable and would be contrary to standard pilot behavior unless under exceptional circumstances, which are not indicated in the premise.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise "The tree has fallen leaves" indicates that the leaves have already detached from the tree and are on the ground. The most direct effect of leaves falling is their accumulation on the ground, which Choice 2 describes as "stacked on the ground." While "stacked" might imply a specific arrangement, it generally refers to leaves being piled up after falling. Choice 1, "The leaves have changed color," is often a cause or precursor to leaves falling, not an effect of them having fallen. Therefore, based on the premise, Choice 2 is the most appropriate effect.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the child complained about needing to go to the bathroom, indicating an urgent need for a restroom. Choice 1, where the father gives him soda, is counterproductive because soda can act as a diuretic and increase the need to urinate, worsening the situation. Choice 2, where the father parks the car at a gas station, is appropriate because gas stations commonly have public restrooms, allowing the child to relieve himself. Thus, Choice 2 is the most logical and helpful response to the child's complaint.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the child sprinkled fish food into the water tank. In typical scenarios, fish are conditioned to associate the sprinkling of food with feeding time. Their natural instinct is to swim towards the food source to consume it, as this is a common behavior observed in aquarium settings. Choice 2, "The fish swam towards food," aligns with this expected reaction. Choice 1, "The fish jumped out of the tank," is not a direct or typical response to food being added; jumping out might occur due to stress or other factors, but it is not causally linked to the sprinkling of food. Therefore, Choice 2 is the most appropriate based on the premise.

The premise states that "Women's political views have changed," which implies a shift in ideological beliefs or affiliations. Changing parties (Choice 1) is a direct and common effect of altered political views, as it reflects a realignment with a political group that matches the new views. Participating in a protest (Choice 2) could be an indirect result of changed views but is more situational and not necessarily a direct consequence, as protests are often issue-specific and can occur without a fundamental change in views. Therefore, Choice 1 is the most appropriate effect.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the sink is clogged, meaning water cannot drain properly. Choice 1, "I turn on the tap," describes an action that, when performed on a clogged sink, would result in water accumulating and potentially overflowing, which is a direct effect of the clog. Choice 2, "I poured sewer cleaner into the sink," is an action taken to address the clog, such as attempting to unclog it, which is not an effect but rather a response to the premise. Therefore, Choice 1 is the most appropriate as it illustrates a consequence of the clogged sink.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise describes the man pressing the wet mouth of the envelope. The "wet mouth" refers to the moistened flap of the envelope, which is typically licked or dampened to activate the adhesive. Pressing this part down is the action used to seal the envelope, ensuring it is closed. This is distinct from stamping, which involves affixing a postage stamp and is not related to moistening or pressing the flap. Therefore, the effect is that he sealed the envelope.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that friends lost contact. Choice 1, "They enjoy each other's company," is unlikely to cause loss of contact because enjoying each other's company typically encourages maintaining or increasing contact. Choice 2, "They moved to different cities," is a common and logical reason for losing contact, as physical distance can lead to reduced communication and eventual loss of touch. Therefore, Choice 2 is the most appropriate cause based on the premise.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise indicates that the accountant mismanaged the company's funds, which is an act of misconduct or poor performance. In typical workplace scenarios, such actions often lead to disciplinary measures, including termination of employment. Choice 1 ("She was fired") directly aligns with this cause-and-effect relationship. Choice 2 ("She took maternity leave") is unrelated to misconduct, as maternity leave is a personal and voluntary decision based on pregnancy or childbirth, not a consequence of job performance issues. Therefore, based on the premise, the most appropriate effect is that she was fired.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states "I look at the clock," which is a visual action. Choice 1, "I heard the ticking of the clock," involves an auditory stimulus that might attract attention but is not necessarily the direct cause for looking at the clock, as hearing does not always lead to visual engagement. Choice 2, "I want to check the time," is a more direct and common reason for looking at a clock, as it aligns with the intention behind the action described in the premise. Therefore, Choice 2 is the most appropriate cause.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise "My hands tightened" suggests a physical response often associated with muscle fatigue or strain from repetitive activities. Writing a paper by hand typically involves prolonged use of hand muscles, which can lead to tightening or cramping. In contrast, holding hands is generally a gentle or affectionate gesture that may not commonly cause hand tightening unless in a specific emotional context, but it is less directly causal for physical tightening. Therefore, Choice 1 is more appropriate as the cause.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the man was wearing a life jacket in the water. Life jackets are typically used to prevent drowning and provide buoyancy, especially for individuals who cannot swim. Choice 1, "He can't swim," directly aligns with this purpose, as non-swimmers often rely on life jackets for safety. Choice 2, "The water is very shallow," is less logical because shallow water generally poses a lower risk of drowning, making a life jacket unnecessary. Therefore, Choice 1 is the most appropriate cause based on common knowledge and typical usage of life jackets.

The premise states that the man put on sunscreen. Sunscreen is typically applied to protect the skin from sun exposure, which is common in sunny environments like the beach. Choice 1, "He sits in the shadows," implies he is in a shaded area where sun exposure is minimal, so it is unlikely to be the cause for applying sunscreen. Choice 2, "He went to the beach," is a common scenario where people apply sunscreen due to anticipated sun exposure, making it the most appropriate cause.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the researchers proved the theory, which means they have demonstrated its validity through evidence or research. When a theory is proven, it is typically accepted by the public because it is supported by scientific proof. Withdrawing a theory (Choice 1) would occur if the theory was disproven or found to be incorrect, which is not the case here. Therefore, the most appropriate effect is that the public accepted the theory (Choice 2).

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that fans booed during the game. Booing is typically an expression of disapproval or dissatisfaction from fans. Common causes include perceived unfairness, such as a referee's incorrect decision, which directly angers fans. Choice 2, "The referee made a wrong judgment," aligns with this, as wrong calls often provoke booing. Choice 1, "The game enters overtime," is less likely to cause booing, as overtime is a neutral or exciting event and not typically a source of displeasure that would lead to booing. Therefore, Choice 2 is the most appropriate cause.

Response: Reasoning process
Entering a combination code on a lock typically refers to providing the correct sequence to unlock it. Combination locks are designed such that when the right code is entered, the lock mechanism disengages, allowing access. Therefore, the effect of entering the combination code should be that the lock is unlocked. Choice 1 ("I locked it") is inconsistent with this action, as locking usually involves a different process, such as closing the lock or engaging it without entering the combination.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the crowd is increasing, which suggests a situation where safety and prevention of separation become priorities, especially for a child. Choice 2, where the father holds his son's hand, directly addresses this by showing a protective action to keep the child safe and close in a crowded environment. Choice 1, where the father hands money to his son, does not logically follow from the crowd increasing, as it is unrelated to crowd dynamics and more likely associated with other contexts like purchasing something. Therefore, Choice 2 is the most appropriate effect.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that "Snow blocked the driveway," which implies an obstruction that needs to be cleared for practical use, such as vehicle access. Choice 1, "I gathered the snow into a snowball," describes an action that might involve playing with snow but does not effectively remove the blockage; it merely reshapes the snow, leaving the driveway potentially still blocked. Choice 2, "I shoveled the snow away," directly addresses the problem by removing the snow, thus clearing the driveway and resolving the obstruction. Therefore, Choice 2 is the most appropriate effect as it logically follows from the premise to mitigate the issue.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the kayaker was paddling. Paddling is an action that propels the kayak forward, typically with the intention of moving towards a destination such as the shore. Therefore, the most direct and logical effect of paddling is progress that could lead to reaching the shore. Choice 1, "The kayak reached the shore," aligns with this outcome as a plausible result of paddling. Choice 2, "The kayak encountered wind and waves," describes an environmental condition that is not caused by paddling; it is an external factor that may influence paddling but is not an effect of it. Thus, based on causality, Choice 1 is the most appropriate.

The premise states that the girl's bicycle got out of control, which is a cause. An effect should be a consequence of this loss of control. Choice 1, "She released the handlebar," is typically a cause of loss of control rather than an effect, as releasing the handlebar could lead to the bicycle becoming uncontrollable. Choice 2, "She hit the fence," is a plausible effect of the bicycle being out of control, as loss of control often results in accidents or collisions.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the husband feels guilty for cheating on his wife. Guilt is an emotion that often motivates individuals to confess their wrongdoings as a way to alleviate their guilt, seek forgiveness, and repair the relationship. Confession aligns with taking responsibility for one's actions. Conversely, accusing the wife of being unfaithful (Choice 1) could be a defense mechanism to project guilt or deflect blame, but this is less directly linked to guilt and more associated with denial or manipulation. Therefore, based on the premise, the most appropriate effect is that he confessed his infidelity (Choice 2).

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the ink on the poster was wiped away, indicating that something caused the ink to become removable. Choice 1, "I waited for the ink to dry," would typically make the ink more permanent and less likely to be wiped away, so it does not align with the premise. Choice 2, "I spilled water on the poster," suggests that water was introduced, which could act as a solvent for the ink, making it wet and easy to wipe away. Therefore, Choice 2 is the most appropriate cause for the ink being wiped away.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the child yelled. Yelling is often a reaction to fear, surprise, or distress. Choice 1, "He had a nightmare," is a common and direct cause of yelling in children, as nightmares can provoke sudden screams or shouts due to fear. Choice 2, "He wet the bed," might cause discomfort or embarrassment, but it is less directly linked to yelling; bed-wetting typically leads to crying or calling for help rather than yelling. Therefore, Choice 1 is the most appropriate cause based on the premise.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the boy put his feet on the table, which is generally considered impolite or inappropriate behavior, especially in a household setting. This action is likely to elicit a response from a parent, such as correction or education about proper manners. Choice 1, "Father sat down at the table," does not directly relate to the boy's action and seems unrelated or coincidental. Choice 2, "His father educated him," is a logical effect because it represents a parental response to teach the boy about appropriate behavior, making it the most appropriate choice based on the premise.

Response: Reasoning process
Based on the premise that my friend turned his head in my direction, I need to determine the most likely cause between calling his name or waving my arms. Calling someone's name is an auditory cue that directly attracts attention and often causes a person to turn their head towards the sound, as hearing one's name triggers a natural response. Waving arms is a visual cue that may attract attention if seen, but it is less direct and might not be effective if the person is not looking in that direction. Therefore, calling his name is the more appropriate and common cause for turning one's head.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the government oppresses its citizens. Oppression typically involves harsh and unfair treatment, which often leads to widespread discontent, anger, and a desire for change among the citizens. Historically, oppression has frequently resulted in rebellions or uprisings as citizens seek to overthrow or resist the oppressive regime. Choice 1, "The citizens launched a rebellion," directly aligns with this cause-and-effect relationship. In contrast, Choice 2, "Citizens register to vote," implies a peaceful, democratic process that may not be effective or even possible under an oppressive government, as such regimes often suppress voting rights or manipulate elections. Therefore, Choice 1 is the most appropriate effect based on the premise.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the boy got lost in the woods. When someone gets lost, especially in a wilderness setting like woods, a common and immediate reaction is to call out for help in an attempt to attract attention and aid. Screaming for help aligns with this instinctive response. Setting up a tent, while a possible survival strategy, is typically not the first action taken upon realizing one is lost; it might occur later if help is not immediately available. Therefore, Choice 2 is the most appropriate effect based on the premise.

Response: Reasoning process
The premise states that the man is jealous of his colleague. Jealousy typically arises from envy over someone else's achievements or advantages, such as career advancement. A promotion is a common cause of jealousy in workplace settings, as it represents success, recognition, and potential benefits. In contrast, working late may indicate hard work or dedication but does not inherently lead to jealousy, as it might be perceived as a burden rather than an enviable achievement. Therefore, Choice 1 is more appropriate as the cause of jealousy.

The premise states that the artist created a new work. To determine the cause, consider which choice is most directly linked to the act of creation. Choice 2, "She felt a burst of inspiration," is a common and positive motivator for artistic creation, as inspiration often drives artists to produce new works. Choice 1, "She criticized her previous work," might lead to self-improvement or reflection but is less directly causative for starting a new piece, as criticism could result in revision or dissatisfaction without necessarily prompting new creation.
