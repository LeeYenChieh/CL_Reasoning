He bought a house for $80,000 and then put in $50,000 for repairs. This increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output should only be in Arabic numeral format.  \n\nChinese Answer  \n首先，我们计算房子的总投资。  \n房子的购买价格是 80,000 美元，维修费用是 50,000 美元。  \n总投资 = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 美元。  \n\n接下来，我们计算房子的最终价值。  \n房子的价值增加了 150%，所以：  \n最终价值 = 80,000 * (1 + 150%) = 80,000 * 2.5 = 200,000 美元。  \n\n最后，我们计算利润。  \n利润 = 最终价值 - 总投资 = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 美元。  \n\n因此，乔希赚了 70,000 美元的利润。  \n70,000  \n\nEnglish Answer  \nFirst, we calculate the total investment in the house.  \nThe purchase price of the house is $80,000, and the repair cost is $50,000.  \nTotal investment = 80,000 + 50,000 = $130,000.  \n\nNext, we calculate the final value of the house.  \nThe value of the house increased by 150%, so:  \nFinal value = 80,000 * (1 + 150%) = 80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000.  \n\nFinally, we calculate the profit.  \nProfit = Final value - Total investment = 200,000 - 130,000 = $70,000.  \n\nTherefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000.  \n70,000  \n\nCompare Answer  \nBoth answers are the same: 70,000.

    "output": "Chinese Problem  \n约翰以每小时 60 英里的速度开了 3 小时，然后掉头，因为他意识到自己把非常重要的东西忘在家里了。他尽量在 4 小时内赶回家，但前 2 个小时都消耗在堵塞的交通中了。在接下来的半个小时，他以每小时 30 英里的速度驾驶，然后在 4 小时剩下的时间里，才能以每小时 80 英里的速度行驶。4 个小时结束后，他距离家还有多远？\n\nEnglish Problem  \nJohn drove for 3 hours at a speed of 60 miles per hour, then turned around because he realized he had forgotten something very important at home. He tried to get back home in 4 hours, but spent the first 2 hours stuck in traffic. In the next half hour, he drove at a speed of 30 miles per hour, and then for the remaining time in the 4 hours, he could drive at a speed of 80 miles per hour. How far is he from home after the 4 hours are up?\n\nChinese Answer  \n首先，我们计算约翰开车的总距离。  \n1. 约翰以每小时 60 英里的速度开了 3 小时，所以他开了：  \n   距离 = 速度 × 时间 = 60 英里/小时 × 3 小时 = 180 英里。  \n   这意味着他离家 180 英里。  \n\n2. 然后他掉头，开始回家，但在前 2 小时都在堵车中，所以他在这段时间内没有行驶任何距离。  \n\n3. 接下来，他以每小时 30 英里的速度行驶了半个小时：  \n   距离 = 速度 × 时间 = 30 英里/小时 × 0.5 小时 = 15 英里。  \n   这时他离家还有 180 英里 - 15 英里 = 165 英里。  \n\n4. 最后，他以每小时 80 英里的速度行驶了 1.5 小时（因为总共 4 小时，前 2 小时堵车，0.5 小时以 30 英里/小时行驶，剩下的时间是 1.5 小时）：  \n   距离 = 速度 × 时间 = 80 英里/小时 × 1.5 小时 = 120 英里。  \n   这时他离家还有 165 英里 - 120 英里 = 45 英里。  \n\n因此，4 个小时结束后，他距离家还有 45 英里。  \n45\n\nEnglish Answer  \nFirst, we calculate the total distance John drove.  \n1. John drove for 3 hours at a speed of 60 miles per hour, so he covered:  \n   Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 3 hours = 180 miles.  \n   This means he is 180 miles away from home.  \n\n2. Then he turned around and started heading back home, but he spent the first 2 hours stuck in traffic, so he did not cover any distance during that time.  \n\n3. Next, he drove for half an hour at a speed of 30 miles per hour:  \n   Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.  \n   At this point, he is 180 miles - 15 miles = 165 miles away from home.  \n\n4. Finally, he drove for 1.5 hours at a speed of 80 miles per hour (since he has a total of 4 hours, 2 hours were spent in traffic, and 0.5 hours driving at 30 miles/hour, leaving 1.5 hours):  \n   Distance = Speed × Time = 80 miles/hour × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.  \n   Now he is 165 miles - 120 miles = 45 miles away from home.  \n\nTherefore, after 4 hours, he is 45 miles away from home.  \n45\n\nCompare Answer  \nThe answers from both the Chinese and English problems are the same: 45 miles. The processes followed in both languages are similar and lead to the same conclusion.\n\nFinal Answer  \n45",

Planting this tree costs $90. The tree produces 7 lemons each year, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. It costs $3 each year to water and fertilize the tree. How many years will it take for him to start making a profit from this lemon tree? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output should only be a number in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer\n首先，我们计算每年从柠檬树上获得的收入。每年结出 7 个柠檬，每个柠檬售价 1.5 美元，因此每年的收入为：\n7 * 1.5 = 10.5 美元\n\n然后，我们计算每年的支出。种树的初始费用为 90 美元，每年浇水和施肥的费用为 3 美元，因此每年的总支出为：\n3 美元\n\n为了计算他需要多少年才能开始盈利，我们需要找出总支出与总收入的关系。设需要的年数为 x，则：\n90 + 3x = 10.5x\n\n将方程整理为：\n90 = 10.5x - 3x\n90 = 7.5x\n\n解这个方程：\nx = 90 / 7.5\nx = 12\n\n因此，卡洛斯需要 12 年才能开始从这棵柠檬树上赚到钱。\n12\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, we calculate the income from the lemon tree each year. The tree produces 7 lemons each year, and each lemon sells for $1.5, so the annual income is:\n7 * 1.5 = $10.5\n\nNext, we calculate the annual expenses. The initial cost of planting the tree is $90, and the annual cost for watering and fertilizing is $3, so the total annual expenses are:\n$3\n\nTo find out how many years it will take for him to start making a profit, we need to relate total expenses to total income. Let the number of years needed be x, then:\n90 + 3x = 10.5x\n\nRearranging the equation gives us:\n90 = 10.5x - 3x\n90 = 7.5x\n\nSolving this equation:\nx = 90 / 7.5\nx = 12\n\nTherefore, Carlos needs 12 years to start making a profit from this lemon tree.\n12\n\nCompare Answer\nBoth the Chinese and English answers indicate that Carlos needs 12 years to start making a profit from the lemon tree.

    "output": "Chinese Problem  \n吉尔担任老师的时薪是 20 美元，担任啦啦队教练的时薪是 30 美元。如果她每年工作 50 周，担任老师每周工作 35 小时，担任教练每周工作 15 小时，则她的年薪是多少？請在輸出的最後輸出答案，最後的輸出只能有數字，數字必須為阿拉伯數字的格式。\n\nEnglish Problem  \nJill's hourly wage as a teacher is $20, and her hourly wage as a cheerleading coach is $30. If she works 50 weeks a year, teaching 35 hours a week and coaching 15 hours a week, what is her annual salary? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output should only contain numbers in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer  \n首先，我们计算吉尔作为老师的年薪。她每周工作 35 小时，时薪是 20 美元。  \n年薪 = 每周工作小时数 × 每周工作周数 × 时薪  \n年薪（老师） = 35 小时 × 50 周 × 20 美元 = 35000 美元  \n\n接下来，我们计算她作为啦啦队教练的年薪。她每周工作 15 小时，时薪是 30 美元。  \n年薪（教练） = 15 小时 × 50 周 × 30 美元 = 22500 美元  \n\n最后，我们将两者的年薪相加：  \n总年薪 = 年薪（老师） + 年薪（教练）  \n总年薪 = 35000 美元 + 22500 美元 = 57500 美元  \n\n57500\n\nEnglish Answer  \nFirst, we calculate Jill's annual salary as a teacher. She works 35 hours a week at an hourly wage of $20.  \nAnnual Salary = Weekly Hours × Weeks Worked × Hourly Wage  \nAnnual Salary (Teacher) = 35 hours × 50 weeks × $20 = $35000  \n\nNext, we calculate her annual salary as a cheerleading coach. She works 15 hours a week at an hourly wage of $30.  \nAnnual Salary (Coach) = 15 hours × 50 weeks × $30 = $22500  \n\nFinally, we add both annual salaries together:  \nTotal Annual Salary = Annual Salary (Teacher) + Annual Salary (Coach)  \nTotal Annual Salary = $35000 + $22500 = $57500  \n\n57500\n\nCompare Answer  \nBoth answers are the same: 57500.

Mary paid a total of $50. If each box of pizza costs $8.50, how many boxes did Mary order?\n\nChinese Answer  \n首先，我们计算玛丽所订购的其他食物的总费用。  \n鸡肉餐的费用是 12 美元。  \n牛奶的费用是 5 盒 × 3 美元/盒 = 15 美元。  \n苹果的费用是 4 个 × 1.50 美元/个 = 6 美元。  \n\n现在，我们将这些费用相加：  \n12 + 15 + 6 = 33 美元。  \n\n玛丽总共支付了 50 美元，因此她用于披萨的费用是：  \n50 - 33 = 17 美元。  \n\n每盒披萨的费用是 8.50 美元，因此她订购的披萨盒数是：  \n17 ÷ 8.50 ≈ 2。  \n\n所以，玛丽订购了 2 盒披萨。  \n2  \n\nEnglish Answer  \nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the other food items Mary ordered.  \nThe cost of the chicken meal is $12.  \nThe cost of the milk is 5 boxes × $3/box = $15.  \nThe cost of the apples is 4 apples × $1.50/apple = $6.  \n\nNow, we add these costs together:  \n12 + 15 + 6 = $33.  \n\nMary paid a total of $50, so the amount spent on pizza is:  \n50 - 33 = $17.  \n\nEach box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes she ordered is:  \n17 ÷ 8.50 ≈ 2.  \n\nTherefore, Mary ordered 2 boxes of pizza.  \n2  \n\nCompare Answer  \nBoth the Chinese and English answers indicate that Mary ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

    "output": "Chinese Problem\n格洛丽亚在买鞋时碰到一双符合她买鞋预算的靴子。然而，她必须在靴子和两双高跟鞋之间做出选择，这两双高跟鞋的总价比靴子少5美元。如果一双高跟鞋33美元，另一双高跟鞋的价格是这个价格的两倍，则靴子的价格是多少？\n\nEnglish Problem\nGloria encounters a pair of boots that fit her shoe budget while shopping for shoes. However, she must choose between the boots and two pairs of high heels, which together cost $5 less than the boots. If one pair of high heels costs $33, and the other pair is priced at twice that amount, what is the price of the boots?\n\nChinese Answer\n设靴子的价格为x美元。两双高跟鞋的总价为33 + 2 * 33 = 99美元。根据题意，靴子的价格比两双高跟鞋的总价多5美元，因此可以列出方程：\nx = 99 + 5\nx = 104\n所以靴子的价格是104美元。\n\n104\n\nEnglish Answer\nLet the price of the boots be x dollars. The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is 33 + 2 * 33 = 99 dollars. According to the problem, the price of the boots is $5 more than the total cost of the two pairs of high heels, so we can set up the equation:\nx = 99 + 5\nx = 104\nThus, the price of the boots is 104 dollars.\n\n104\n\nCompare Answer\nBoth answers are the same, with the price of the boots calculated as 104 dollars in both languages.\n\nFinal Answer\n104",

Please output the answer at the end, and the final output must only be a number in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer  \n迈克在前 20 分钟里得了 4 分。在后 20 分钟里，他的得分提高了 25%。  \n后 20 分钟的得分 = 4 分 × 25% = 4 分 × 0.25 = 1 分。  \n所以后 20 分钟的得分 = 4 分 + 1 分 = 5 分。  \n总得分 = 前 20 分钟的得分 + 后 20 分钟的得分 = 4 分 + 5 分 = 9 分。  \n因此，迈克的总得分是 9。\n\n9\n\nEnglish Answer  \nMike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. In the last 20 minutes, his score increased by 25%.  \nThe increase in score for the last 20 minutes = 4 points × 25% = 4 points × 0.25 = 1 point.  \nSo, the score for the last 20 minutes = 4 points + 1 point = 5 points.  \nTotal score = Score from the first 20 minutes + Score from the last 20 minutes = 4 points + 5 points = 9 points.  \nTherefore, Mike's total score is 9.\n\n9\n\nCompare Answer  \nBoth answers are the same: 9.\n\nFinal Answer  \n9",

Please output the answer at the end, and it must only be a number in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer  \n首先，我们设戴娜的步行速度为 \\( x \\) 英里/小时。  \n那么她的跑步速度为 \\( 4x \\) 英里/小时，跳跃速度为 \\( 2x \\) 英里/小时。  \n根据题目，跳跃速度为 3 英里/小时，所以我们有：  \n\\[ 2x = 3 \\]  \n解得：  \n\\[ x = 1.5 \\]  \n因此，戴娜的步行速度是 1.5 英里/小时，跑步速度是：  \n\\[ 4x = 4 \\times 1.5 = 6 \\]  \n所以，跑步速度是 6 英里/小时。  \n\n在 6 小时的时间里，戴娜用三分之一的时间跑步，用三分之二的时间步行：  \n跑步时间：  \n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\times 6 = 2 \\text{ 小时} \\]  \n步行时间：  \n\\[ \\frac{2}{3} \\times 6 = 4 \\text{ 小时} \\]  \n\n跑步的距离：  \n\\[ 6 \\text{ 英里/小时} \\times 2 \\text{ 小时} = 12 \\text{ 英里} \\]  \n步行的距离：  \n\\[ 1.5 \\text{ 英里/小时} \\times 4 \\text{ 小时} = 6 \\text{ 英里} \\]  \n\n总距离：  \n\\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \\text{ 英里} \\]  \n\n所以，戴娜能走的总距离是 18 英里。  \n18\n\nEnglish Answer  \nLet Diana's walking speed be \\( x \\) miles per hour.  \nThen her running speed is \\( 4x \\) miles per hour, and her jumping speed is \\( 2x \\) miles per hour.  \nAccording to the problem, her jumping speed is 3 miles per hour, so we have:  \n\\[ 2x = 3 \\]  \nSolving for \\( x \\):  \n\\[ x = 1.5 \\]  \nThus, Diana's walking speed is 1.5 miles per hour, and her running speed is:  \n\\[ 4x = 4 \\times 1.5 = 6 \\]  \nSo, her running speed is 6 miles per hour.  \n\nIn 6 hours, Diana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking:  \nRunning time:  \n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\times 6 = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]  \nWalking time:  \n\\[ \\frac{2}{3} \\times 6 = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]  \n\nDistance run:  \n\\[ 6 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 12 \\text{ miles} \\]  \nDistance walked:  \n\\[ 1.5 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 4 \\text{ hours} = 6 \\text{ miles} \\]  \n\nTotal distance:  \n\\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \\text{ miles} \\]  \n\nTherefore, the total distance Diana can travel is 18 miles.  \n18\n\nCompare Answer  \nBoth the Chinese and English answers are the same: 18 miles.\n\nFinal Answer  \n18",

Polly can throw the only known dragon-slaying weapon, the golden spear, a distance of 400 feet, which is just within the dragon's fire range. However, when Polly is holding the sapphire, she can throw the spear three times farther than when she is not holding the sapphire. If Polly is holding the sapphire, how far away can she stand outside the dragon's fire range to hit the dragon with the spear?\n\nChinese Answer\n首先，巨龙的喷火范围是 1,000 英尺。波利在没有蓝宝石时能扔出金枪 400 英尺，这个距离在喷火范围内。拿着蓝宝石时，波利能扔出金枪的距离是 400 英尺的三倍，即 1,200 英尺。\n\n为了击中巨龙，波利需要站在喷火范围以外。喷火范围是 1,000 英尺，因此她可以站在 1,200 英尺 - 1,000 英尺 = 200 英尺的地方。\n\n所以，波利能站在巨龙喷火范围以外的距离是 200 英尺。\n\n200\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, the dragon's fire range is 1,000 feet. Polly can throw the golden spear 400 feet without the sapphire, which is within the fire range. When holding the sapphire, she can throw the spear three times farther, which is 1,200 feet.\n\nTo hit the dragon, Polly needs to stand outside the fire range. The fire range is 1,000 feet, so she can stand at a distance of 1,200 feet - 1,000 feet = 200 feet away.\n\nThus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's fire range.\n\n200\n\nCompare Answer\nThe answers from both the Chinese and English problems are the same, both stating that Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's fire range.

He can make 10 cone-shaped candles from one pound of beeswax. The cost of one pound of beeswax and the necessary candle wicks is $10.00. If he sells each candle for $2.00, how much net profit will he make if he produces and sells 20 candles? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output should only contain numbers in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer\n首先，我们计算制作 20 根蜡烛所需的蜂蜡量。每磅蜂蜡可以制作 10 根蜡烛，因此制作 20 根蜡烛需要 20 / 10 = 2 磅蜂蜡。\n\n然后，我们计算制作 20 根蜡烛的总成本。每磅蜂蜡的成本是 10.00 美元，因此 2 磅蜂蜡的成本是 2 * 10.00 = 20.00 美元。\n\n接下来，我们计算销售 20 根蜡烛的总收入。每根蜡烛的售价是 2.00 美元，因此销售 20 根蜡烛的总收入是 20 * 2.00 = 40.00 美元。\n\n最后，我们计算净利润。净利润 = 总收入 - 总成本 = 40.00 - 20.00 = 20.00 美元。\n\n因此，查理制作并销售 20 根蜡烛能获得的净利润是 20.00 美元。\n20\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, we calculate the amount of beeswax needed to produce 20 candles. Since one pound of beeswax can make 10 candles, producing 20 candles requires 20 / 10 = 2 pounds of beeswax.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of making 20 candles. The cost of one pound of beeswax is $10.00, so the cost for 2 pounds of beeswax is 2 * 10.00 = $20.00.\n\nThen, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles. Each candle sells for $2.00, so the total revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * 2.00 = $40.00.\n\nFinally, we calculate the net profit. Net profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.\n\nTherefore, the net profit Charlie will make from producing and selling 20 candles is $20.00.\n20\n\nCompare Answer\nThe answers from both the Chinese and English problems are the same, both yielding a net profit of 20.

On her way to work, she stopped at a store and bought a pack of sticky notes; during work, she put a sticky note on each of the 220 different coffee cups. If she has 23 sticky notes left in total, how many sticky notes were in the pack she bought? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output should only contain numbers in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer  \n首先，坎迪斯最初有 80 张便利贴。她在工作时给 220 个咖啡杯贴了便利贴，因此她使用了 220 张便利贴。  \n她最后剩下 23 张便利贴。  \n我们可以设她买的便利贴数量为 x。  \n根据题意，我们可以列出以下方程：  \n80 + x - 220 = 23  \n简化这个方程：  \n80 + x = 220 + 23  \n80 + x = 243  \nx = 243 - 80  \nx = 163  \n所以，她买的那包便利贴里面有 163 张便利贴。  \n163\n\nEnglish Answer  \nFirst, Candice initially had 80 sticky notes. She used 220 sticky notes for the coffee cups during work.  \nShe has 23 sticky notes left in total.  \nLet’s denote the number of sticky notes she bought as x.  \nAccording to the problem, we can set up the following equation:  \n80 + x - 220 = 23  \nSimplifying this equation:  \n80 + x = 220 + 23  \n80 + x = 243  \nx = 243 - 80  \nx = 163  \nTherefore, the pack of sticky notes she bought contained 163 sticky notes.  \n163\n\nCompare Answer  \nThe answers from both languages are the same, and the processes followed to reach the answers are identical.\n\nFinal Answer  \n163",

The price of the red ties is 50% higher than the price of the blue ties. He spent $200 buying blue ties that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties?\n\nChinese Answer\n设蓝色领带的数量为 x，则红色领带的数量为 2x。蓝色领带的价格为 40 美元，红色领带的价格为 40 * 1.5 = 60 美元。\n\n根据题意，约翰花了 200 美元购买蓝色领带，因此蓝色领带的数量为：\n200 / 40 = 5（条）\n\n所以，蓝色领带的数量 x = 5，红色领带的数量为 2x = 10。\n\n约翰购买红色领带的总花费为：\n10 * 60 = 600（美元）\n\n因此，约翰总共花了：\n200 + 600 = 800（美元）\n\n{Chinese Final Answer}\n800\n\nEnglish Answer\nLet the number of blue ties be x, then the number of red ties is 2x.

    "output": "Chinese Problem  \n乌利亚的书包对他来说太重了。他需要把书包减轻 15 磅。他的漫画书每本重 1/4 磅，他的玩具每件重 1/2 磅。如果他拿掉 30 本漫画书，他还需要拿掉多少件玩具？請在輸出的最後輸出答案，最後的輸出只能有數字，數字必須為阿拉伯數字的格式。\n\nEnglish Problem  \nUriah's backpack is too heavy for him. He needs to lighten it by 15 pounds. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each, and his toys weigh 1/2 pound each. If he removes 30 comic books, how many toys does he still need to remove? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output should only have numbers in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer  \n首先，我们计算乌利亚通过拿掉 30 本漫画书减轻了多少重量。每本漫画书重 1/4 磅，因此拿掉 30 本漫画书减轻的重量为：  \n30 × (1/4) = 30/4 = 7.5 磅。\n\n接下来，乌利亚需要减轻的总重量是 15 磅，因此他还需要减轻的重量为：  \n15 - 7.5 = 7.5 磅。\n\n现在，我们知道每件玩具重 1/2 磅。为了找出他还需要拿掉多少件玩具，我们可以用剩余需要减轻的重量除以每件玩具的重量：  \n7.5 ÷ (1/2) = 7.5 × 2 = 15 件玩具。\n\n因此，乌利亚还需要拿掉 15 件玩具。  \n15\n\nEnglish Answer  \nFirst, we calculate how much weight Uriah lightens by removing 30 comic books. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, so the weight reduced by removing 30 comic books is:  \n30 × (1/4) = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds.\n\nNext, Uriah needs to lighten the total weight by 15 pounds, so the remaining weight he needs to lighten is:  \n15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.\n\nNow, we know that each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he still needs to remove, we can divide the remaining weight to lighten by the weight of each toy:  \n7.5 ÷ (1/2) = 7.5 × 2 = 15 toys.\n\nThus, Uriah still needs to remove 15 toys.  \n15\n\nCompare Answer  \nBoth the Chinese and English answers indicate that Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The processes in both languages are identical, leading to the same conclusion.\n\nFinal Answer  \n15",

His final bill amount is $40.00. Because this order was processed through a delivery service, they added a 25% fee to his final bill total and charged him a $3.00 delivery fee. Stephen also added a $4.00 tip. After adding these extra charges, what is the final price Stephen paid for the household items? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output should only be a number, formatted in Arabic numerals.\n\nChinese Answer  \n首先，我们计算订单的 25% 费用：  \n25% 的费用 = 40.00 * 0.25 = 10.00 美元。  \n\n然后，我们将这个费用加到原始账单上：  \n40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00 美元。  \n\n接下来，加上送货费：  \n50.00 + 3.00 = 53.00 美元。  \n\n最后，加上小费：  \n53.00 + 4.00 = 57.00 美元。  \n\n因此，史蒂芬购买生活用品的最终价格是 57.00 美元。  \n57.00  \n\nEnglish Answer  \nFirst, we calculate the 25% fee on the order:  \n25% fee = 40.00 * 0.25 = 10.00 dollars.  \n\nNext, we add this fee to the original bill:  \n40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00 dollars.  \n\nThen, we add the delivery fee:  \n50.00 + 3.00 = 53.00 dollars.  \n\nFinally, we add the tip:  \n53.00 + 4.00 = 57.00 dollars.  \n\nTherefore, the final price Stephen paid for the household items is 57.00 dollars.  \n57.00  \n\nCompare Answer  \nBoth answers are the same: 57.00.

    "output": "Chinese Problem\n索菲亚正在考虑自驾游，她想知道一箱汽油能行驶多长距离。自上次加油以来，她已经行驶了 100 英里，并且她需要加 4 加仑的汽油才能再次把油箱装满。根据她汽车使用手册的说明，她的油箱能装 12 加仑汽油。一箱汽油能让索菲亚行驶多长距离？請在輸出的最後輸出答案，最後的輸出只能有數字，數字必須為阿拉伯數字的格式\n\nEnglish Problem\nSophia is considering a road trip, and she wants to know how far she can travel on a full tank of gas. Since her last fill-up, she has driven 100 miles and needed to add 4 gallons of gas to fill the tank again. According to her car's manual, her gas tank can hold 12 gallons. How far can Sophia travel on a full tank of gas? Please output only a number at the end, and the number must be in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer\n首先，我们知道索菲亚的油箱容量是 12 加仑。她在上次加油后行驶了 100 英里，并且加了 4 加仑的油。这意味着她在这 100 英里中消耗了 4 加仑的油。\n\n接下来，我们可以计算出每加仑油能行驶的距离：\n每加仑油能行驶的距离 = 100 英里 / 4 加仑 = 25 英里/加仑。\n\n然后，我们可以计算一箱油（12 加仑）能行驶的总距离：\n一箱油能行驶的距离 = 25 英里/加仑 × 12 加仑 = 300 英里。\n\n因此，索菲亚一箱汽油能行驶的距离是 300 英里。\n300\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, we know that Sophia's gas tank capacity is 12 gallons. Since her last fill-up, she has driven 100 miles and needed to add 4 gallons of gas to fill the tank again. This means she consumed 4 gallons of gas over the 100 miles.\n\nNext, we can calculate the distance she can travel per gallon:\nDistance per gallon = 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles/gallon.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total distance she can travel on a full tank (12 gallons):\nTotal distance on a full tank = 25 miles/gallon × 12 gallons = 300 miles.\n\nTherefore, Sophia can travel 300 miles on a full tank of gas.\n300\n\nCompare Answer\nThe answers from both the Chinese and English problems are the same: 300. The processes followed in both languages are also identical, leading to the same conclusion.\n\nFinal Answer\n300",

If each class has 15 students and she charges each student $15.00 in tuition, how much can she earn in a week? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output should only contain numbers in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer  \n首先，我们计算朱迪在工作日的收入。她每天教授 5 节课，工作日有 5 天，因此她每周教授的课数为：  \n5 节课/天 × 5 天 = 25 节课  \n\n然后，计算周六的课数：  \n8 节课  \n\n所以，朱迪每周教授的总课数为：  \n25 节课 + 8 节课 = 33 节课  \n\n每节课有 15 个学生，因此每周的学生总数为：  \n33 节课 × 15 学生/节 = 495 学生  \n\n每个学生的学费是 15.00 美元，因此她每周的总收入为：  \n495 学生 × 15.00 美元/学生 = 7425.00 美元  \n\n最后，输出答案：  \n7425  \n\nChinese Final Answer  \n7425\n\nEnglish Answer  \nFirst, we calculate Judy's income on weekdays. She teaches 5 classes each day, and there are 5 weekdays, so the total number of classes she teaches during the week is:  \n5 classes/day × 5 days = 25 classes  \n\nNext, we calculate the number of classes on Saturday:  \n8 classes  \n\nThus, the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week is:  \n25 classes + 8 classes = 33 classes  \n\nEach class has 15 students, so the total number of students per week is:  \n33 classes × 15 students/class = 495 students  \n\nEach student pays a tuition fee of $15.00, so her total income for the week is:  \n495 students × $15.00/student = $7425.00  \n\nFinally, output the answer:  \n7425  \n\nEnglish Final Answer  \n7425  \n\nCompare Answer  \nBoth answers are the same: 7425.

He sells three types of flowers: marigolds, petunias, and begonias. He usually sells a pot of marigolds for $2.74, a pot of petunias for $1.87, and a pot of begonias for $2.12. Today, Yati does not have any change, so he decides to round all prices to the nearest dollar.

According to the problem, the area of each layer is half of the area of the layer below it.  \n- Layer 1 (top layer) area = 16  \n- Layer 2 area = 16 / 2 = 8  \n- Layer 3 area = 8 / 2 = 4  \n- Layer 4 area = 4 / 2 = 2  \n\nNow we can calculate the total area of all layers:  \nTotal area = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30  \n\nNext, we calculate the average area:  \nAverage area = Total area / Number of layers = 30 / 4 = 7.5  \n\nSo, the final answer is:  \n7.5  \n\nEnglish Final Answer  \n7.5  \n\nCompare Answer  \nThe answers from both the Chinese and English versions are the same (7.5). The processes followed in both languages are also identical.  \n\nFinal Answer  \n7.5",

According to the veterinarian's advice, for the first 180 days, she must feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day. Then for the rest of the puppy's life, she must feed it 2 cups of dog food every day. If 1 bag of dog food contains 110 cups of dog food, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year? Please output only a number at the end, and the number must be in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer\n首先，我们计算塞西莉亚在前180天喂小狗所需的狗粮量。每天1杯，180天的总量为：\n1杯/天 × 180天 = 180杯。\n\n接下来，我们计算在接下来的185天（因为一年有365天，365 - 180 = 185天）中，她每天喂2杯狗粮的总量：\n2杯/天 × 185天 = 370杯。\n\n然后，我们将两部分的狗粮量相加：\n180杯 + 370杯 = 550杯。\n\n最后，我们计算塞西莉亚需要多少袋狗粮：\n550杯 ÷ 110杯/袋 = 5袋。\n\n因此，塞西莉亚在第一年用掉的袋数为5袋。\n5\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, we calculate the amount of dog food Cecilia needs for the first 180 days. She feeds the puppy 1 cup per day, so for 180 days, the total amount is:\n1 cup/day × 180 days = 180 cups.\n\nNext, we calculate the amount of dog food needed for the remaining 185 days (since there are 365 days in a year, 365 - 180 = 185 days) where she feeds 2 cups per day:\n2 cups/day × 185 days = 370 cups.\n\nNow, we add the two amounts of dog food together:\n180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.\n\nFinally, we calculate how many bags of dog food Cecilia will need:\n550 cups ÷ 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.\n\nTherefore, the number of bags Cecilia will use in the first year is 5.\n5\n\nCompare Answer\nBoth answers are the same, with both calculations leading to the conclusion that Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.\n\nFinal Answer\n5",

Each rose has 8 thorns. How many thorns are there in total? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output must only be a number in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer  \n首先，我们计算每个玫瑰丛的刺的数量。每个玫瑰丛有 25 朵玫瑰，每朵玫瑰有 8 根刺，因此每个玫瑰丛的刺的数量为：  \n25 朵玫瑰 × 8 根刺/朵 = 200 根刺。  \n\n然后，我们计算 3 棵玫瑰丛的总刺的数量：  \n200 根刺/丛 × 3 丛 = 600 根刺。  \n\n所以，总共有 600 根刺。  \n600\n\nEnglish Answer  \nFirst, we calculate the number of thorns for each rose bush. Each rose bush has 25 roses, and each rose has 8 thorns, so the number of thorns per rose bush is:  \n25 roses × 8 thorns/rose = 200 thorns.  \n\nNext, we calculate the total number of thorns for 3 rose bushes:  \n200 thorns/bush × 3 bushes = 600 thorns.  \n\nTherefore, the total number of thorns is 600.  \n600\n\nCompare Answer  \nBoth answers are the same: 600.

The company has a policy that for employees who have worked for the company for 5 years, their salary can be increased by 10% of the initial salary for each year. If Sylvie has just completed 5 years at the company last December, what will her annual salary be after working for three more years? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output should only contain numbers in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer\n首先，计算西尔维的初始年薪：\n每月工资 = 600 美元\n年薪 = 每月工资 × 12 = 600 × 12 = 7200 美元\n\n西尔维在公司工作满 5 年后，她的年薪将增加：\n每年增加 = 初始年薪 × 10% = 7200 × 0.1 = 720 美元\n\n在接下来的三年中，她的年薪将增加：\n三年总增加 = 每年增加 × 3 = 720 × 3 = 2160 美元\n\n所以，西尔维在工作满 8 年后的年薪为：\n年薪 = 初始年薪 + 三年总增加 = 7200 + 2160 = 9360 美元\n\n9360\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, calculate Sylvie's initial annual salary:\nMonthly salary = $600\nAnnual salary = Monthly salary × 12 = 600 × 12 = $7200\n\nAfter working for 5 years, her salary will increase:\nAnnual increase = Initial annual salary × 10% = 7200 × 0.1 = $720\n\nIn the next three years, her salary will increase:\nTotal increase over three years = Annual increase × 3 = 720 × 3 = $2160\n\nTherefore, Sylvie's annual salary after working for 8 years will be:\nAnnual salary = Initial annual salary + Total increase = 7200 + 2160 = $9360\n\n9360\n\nCompare Answer\nBoth answers are the same: 9360.\n\nFinal Answer\n9360",

Please output the answer at the end, and the final output should only be a number in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer  \n首先，李完成400米跨栏的时间是38秒。由于李比杰拉尔德快2秒，因此杰拉尔德的原始时间是38秒 + 2秒 = 40秒。  \n杰拉尔德改善饮食后，速度提高了10%。这意味着他的时间会减少10%。  \n计算杰拉尔德改善饮食后的时间：  \n40秒 × (1 - 0.10) = 40秒 × 0.90 = 36秒。  \n\n因此，杰拉尔德在改善饮食后能以36秒完成400米跨栏。  \n36\n\nEnglish Answer  \nFirst, Li completes the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. Since Li is 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Gerald's original time is 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds.  \nAfter improving his diet, Gerald's speed increases by 10%. This means his time will decrease by 10%.  \nCalculating Gerald's time after improving his diet:  \n40 seconds × (1 - 0.10) = 40 seconds × 0.90 = 36 seconds.  \n\nTherefore, Gerald can complete the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds after improving his diet.  \n36\n\nCompare Answer  \nBoth answers are the same: 36 seconds. The processes are identical in both languages.\n\nFinal Answer  \n36",

Please output the answer at the end, and it should only be a number in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer\n首先，我们计算约翰在工作日喝水的次数。工作日有5天，每天喝4杯水（早餐、午餐、晚餐和睡前）。所以，工作日总共喝水的杯数是：\n5天 × 4杯/天 = 20杯\n\n接下来，我们计算周末（2天）喝水的次数。周末他只在早餐、午餐和睡前喝水，每天喝3杯水。因此，周末总共喝水的杯数是：\n2天 × 3杯/天 = 6杯\n\n最后，我们将工作日和周末的总杯数相加：\n20杯 + 6杯 = 26杯\n\n所以，约翰一周喝水的总杯数是26杯。\n26\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, we calculate how many glasses of water John drinks on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays, and he drinks 4 glasses of water each day (one during breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed). Therefore, the total number of glasses he drinks on weekdays is:\n5 days × 4 glasses/day = 20 glasses\n\nNext, we calculate how many glasses he drinks on weekends (2 days). On weekends, he only drinks water during breakfast, lunch, and before bed, which totals 3 glasses of water each day. Thus, the total number of glasses he drinks on weekends is:\n2 days × 3 glasses/day = 6 glasses\n\nFinally, we add the total glasses from weekdays and weekends:\n20 glasses + 6 glasses = 26 glasses\n\nSo, John drinks a total of 26 glasses of water in a week.\n26\n\nCompare Answer\nThe answers from both the Chinese and English problems are the same: 26.

The external dimensions of the box are 5 inches × 6 inches × 4 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick, so the internal dimensions are:  \n- Internal length = 5 - 2 × 1 = 3 inches  \n- Internal width = 6 - 2 × 1 = 4 inches  \n- Internal height = 4 - 2 × 1 = 2 inches  \n\nNext, we calculate the internal volume of each box:  \nInternal volume = Internal length × Internal width × Internal height = 3 × 4 × 2 = 24 cubic inches  \n\nSince John has 3 boxes, the total internal volume is:  \nTotal internal volume = 3 × 24 = 72 cubic inches  \n\n72\n\nCompare Answer  \nThe answers from both the Chinese and English problems are the same: 72.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watches one episode of his favorite show each night, with each episode lasting 1 hour. On Wednesday, he watched several episodes, each lasting 30 minutes. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched one 1-hour episode and one 30-minute episode. On Friday, because it's the weekend, he stayed up late and watched 2 episodes, each lasting 1 hour. If he watched a total of 7 hours of TV, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?\n\nChinese Answer\n首先，我们计算弗兰基在周一、周二、周四和周五观看电视的总时间。\n\n- 周一：1小时\n- 周二：1小时\n- 周四：1小时 + 0.5小时 = 1.5小时\n- 周五：2小时\n\n将这些时间相加：\n1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5小时\n\n弗兰基总共看了7小时的电视，因此周三他观看的时间为：\n7 - 5.5 = 1.5小时\n\n周三每集节目30分钟，所以1.5小时等于：\n1.5小时 = 90分钟\n\n90分钟 ÷ 30分钟/集 = 3集\n\n所以，弗兰基在周三看了3集每集30分钟的节目。\n3\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, let's calculate the total time Frankie spent watching TV on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.\n\n- Monday: 1 hour\n- Tuesday: 1 hour\n- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hour = 1.5 hours\n- Friday: 2 hours\n\nNow, we add these times together:\n1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours\n\nSince Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time he spent watching on Wednesday is:\n7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours\n\nEach episode on Wednesday lasts 30 minutes, so 1.5 hours equals:\n1.5 hours = 90 minutes\n\n90 minutes ÷ 30 minutes/episode = 3 episodes\n\nThus, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes each on Wednesday.\n3\n\nCompare Answer\nBoth answers indicate that Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes each on Wednesday. The processes followed in both languages are identical, leading to the same conclusion.\n\nFinal Answer\n3",

    "output": "Chinese Problem  \n朱莉娅在湖上时，她的船漏水了。她朝着岸边每划10英尺，船就进水2升。她用16秒划了20英尺。到达岸边需要64秒。当朱莉娅到达岸边时，船的进水量是多少？請在輸出的最後輸出答案，最後的輸出只能有數字，數字必須為阿拉伯數字的格式。\n\nEnglish Problem  \nWhile Julia was on the lake, her boat started to leak. For every 10 feet she rows towards the shore, the boat takes in 2 liters of water. She rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds. It will take her 64 seconds to reach the shore. How much water will have entered the boat by the time Julia reaches the shore? Please output only a number at the end, and the number must be in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer  \n首先，我们知道朱莉娅划了20英尺，花费了16秒。根据题目，她到达岸边需要64秒。  \n朱莉娅到达岸边的总时间是16秒 + 64秒 = 80秒。  \n在80秒内，她将划行的距离为：  \n80秒 / 16秒 * 20英尺 = 100英尺。  \n\n每划10英尺，船就进水2升，因此100英尺进水量为：  \n(100英尺 / 10英尺) * 2升 = 20升。  \n\n所以，当朱莉娅到达岸边时，船的进水量是20升。  \n20  \n\nEnglish Answer  \nFirst, we know that Julia rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds. According to the problem, it will take her 64 seconds to reach the shore.  \nThe total time it takes for Julia to reach the shore is 16 seconds + 64 seconds = 80 seconds.  \nIn 80 seconds, the distance she will row is:  \n80 seconds / 16 seconds * 20 feet = 100 feet.  \n\nFor every 10 feet she rows, the boat takes in 2 liters of water, so the amount of water for 100 feet is:  \n(100 feet / 10 feet) * 2 liters = 20 liters.  \n\nTherefore, by the time Julia reaches the shore, the amount of water that has entered the boat is 20 liters.  \n20  \n\nCompare Answer  \nBoth answers are the same, with both calculations leading to the conclusion that the amount of water that has entered the boat is 20 liters.\n\nFinal Answer  \n20",

Please output only a number at the end, and the number must be in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer  \n首先，我们知道有4位老师，每位老师每天有2节课。  \n所以，老师每天的总节数为：  \n4位老师 × 2节课/位老师 = 8节课。  \n\n每节课擦3次白板，因此每天擦白板的总次数为：  \n8节课 × 3次/节课 = 24次。  \n\n所以，白板每天擦的次数是24次。  \n24\n\nEnglish Answer  \nFirst, we know that there are 4 teachers, and each teacher has 2 classes per day.  \nThus, the total number of classes per day is:  \n4 teachers × 2 classes/teacher = 8 classes.  \n\nEach class wipes the whiteboard 3 times, so the total number of times the whiteboard is wiped each day is:  \n8 classes × 3 times/class = 24 times.  \n\nTherefore, the whiteboard is wiped 24 times each day.  \n24\n\nCompare Answer  \nBoth answers are the same: 24.

Since she has some leftover lumber, she decided to sell it. She has 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing her $10. She also has 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing her $16. If she sells all of them, how much profit will she make?

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:  \n   - Cost: 10 pieces × $10 = $100  \n   - Selling price: $10 × 1.5 = $15 (50% increase)  \n   - Total selling price: 10 pieces × $15 = $150  \n\n2. For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:  \n   - Cost: 5 pieces × $16 = $80  \n   - Selling price: $16 × 1.5 = $24 (50% increase)  \n   - Total selling price: 5 pieces × $24 = $120  \n\n3. Total cost: $100 + $80 = $180  \n4. Total selling price: $150 + $120 = $270  \n5. Profit: Total selling price - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90  \n\nTherefore, the profit Sasha can make is $90.  \n90\n\nCompare Answer  \nThe answers from both the Chinese and English problems are the same: 90.

For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day because she had to complete some tasks. If she sleeps 1 hour more than those two days for the remaining time of the week, how many hours did she sleep in total for the entire week? Please output the answer at the end, and it must only be in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer\n首先，莎蒂周一睡了 8 小时。接下来两天她各少睡了 2 小时，所以：\n- 周二睡了 8 - 2 = 6 小时\n- 周三睡了 8 - 2 = 6 小时\n\n接下来计算这三天的总睡眠时间：\n8 + 6 + 6 = 20 小时\n\n接下来的四天，她比周二和周三多睡 1 小时，所以她在这四天中每天睡 6 + 1 = 7 小时：\n- 周四、周五、周六、周日各睡 7 小时。\n\n四天的总睡眠时间为：\n7 * 4 = 28 小时\n\n最后，整个星期的总睡眠时间为：\n20 + 28 = 48 小时\n\n因此，莎蒂在整个星期一共睡了 48 个小时。\n48\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, Shati slept for 8 hours on Monday. For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, so:\n- On Tuesday, she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours\n- On Wednesday, she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours\n\nNext, we calculate the total sleep time for these three days:\n8 + 6 + 6 = 20 hours\n\nFor the remaining four days, she sleeps 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she sleeps 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day:\n- Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, she sleeps 7 hours each.\n\nThe total sleep time for these four days is:\n7 * 4 = 28 hours\n\nFinally, the total sleep time for the entire week is:\n20 + 28 = 48 hours\n\nThus, Shati slept a total of 48 hours for the entire week.\n48\n\nCompare Answer\nThe answers from both languages are the same, both concluding that Shati slept a total of 48 hours for the entire week. The processes followed in both languages are also identical.\n\nFinal Answer\n48",

The average consultation time for each patient is 24 minutes. The doctor charges the hospital $150 per hour, and the hospital charges patients $200 per hour. How much profit does the hospital make from these consultations? Please output the answer at the end, and it must only be a number in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer  \n首先，我们计算每天的总看诊时间。  \n每位患者的看诊时长为 24 分钟，500 位患者的总看诊时间为：  \n500 × 24 = 12000 分钟。  \n将分钟转换为小时：  \n12000 分钟 ÷ 60 = 200 小时。  \n\n接下来，我们计算医院从患者那里获得的收入：  \n医院对患者收费每小时 200 美元，200 小时的收入为：  \n200 × 200 = 40000 美元。  \n\n然后，我们计算医院支付给医生的费用：  \n医生对医院收费每小时 150 美元，200 小时的费用为：  \n200 × 150 = 30000 美元。  \n\n最后，我们计算医院的利润：  \n利润 = 收入 - 支出 = 40000 - 30000 = 10000 美元。  \n\n因此，医院从这些就诊中获得的利润是：  \n10000  \n\nChinese Final Answer  \n10000\n\nEnglish Answer  \nFirst, we calculate the total consultation time for the day.  \nEach patient has an average consultation time of 24 minutes, so for 500 patients, the total consultation time is:  \n500 × 24 = 12000 minutes.  \nConverting minutes to hours:  \n12000 minutes ÷ 60 = 200 hours.  \n\nNext, we calculate the revenue the hospital earns from patients:  \nThe hospital charges patients $200 per hour, so for 200 hours, the revenue is:  \n200 × 200 = $40000.  \n\nThen, we calculate the cost the hospital pays to the doctors:  \nThe doctor charges the hospital $150 per hour, so for 200 hours, the cost is:  \n200 × 150 = $30000.  \n\nFinally, we calculate the profit for the hospital:  \nProfit = Revenue - Cost = 40000 - 30000 = 10000 dollars.  \n\nThus, the profit the hospital makes from these consultations is:  \n10000  \n\nEnglish Final Answer  \n10000\n\nCompare Answer  \nThe answers from both the Chinese and English problems are the same, both yielding a profit of 10000.

What is the percentage of semi-automatic cars? Please output the answer at the end, and it should only be a number in Arabic numeral format.  \n\nChinese Answer  \n首先，我们知道总共有 20 辆车，其中 12 辆是自动挡，4 辆是手动挡。我们可以计算半自动挡汽车的数量：  \n半自动挡汽车的数量 = 总数 - 自动挡数量 - 手动挡数量  \n= 20 - 12 - 4  \n= 4 辆半自动挡汽车。  \n\n接下来，我们计算半自动挡汽车的百分比：  \n半自动挡汽车的百分比 = (半自动挡汽车数量 / 总汽车数量) × 100%  \n= (4 / 20) × 100%  \n= 20%。  \n\n因此，半自动挡汽车的百分比是 20。  \n20  \n\nEnglish Answer  \nFirst, we know there are a total of 20 cars, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. We can calculate the number of semi-automatic cars:  \nNumber of semi-automatic cars = Total cars - Number of automatic cars - Number of manual cars  \n= 20 - 12 - 4  \n= 4 semi-automatic cars.  \n\nNext, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:  \nPercentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) × 100%  \n= (4 / 20) × 100%  \n= 20%.  \n\nThus, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20.  \n20  \n\nCompare Answer  \nBoth the Chinese and English answers are the same, with both concluding that the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20.

He currently has 3 clients but is negotiating with an additional 5 potential clients and is confident he can include them in his calculations. Cleaning each client's house will require 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. Each bottle of bleach costs $2, and each pack of cloths costs $5. These are his only expenses. According to his calculations, his total income per week will be $92. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so how much profit will Kim make each week? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output should only be a number in Arabic numeral format.  \n\nChinese Answer  \n首先，我们需要计算金姆的总支出。  \n每位客户需要的漂白剂和抹布的费用如下：  \n- 每位客户需要 2 瓶漂白剂，每瓶 2 美元，所以漂白剂的费用是：  \n  \\(2 \\text{ 瓶} \\times 2 \\text{ 美元/瓶} = 4 \\text{ 美元}\\)  \n- 每位客户需要 1 包抹布，抹布的费用是：  \n  \\(1 \\text{ 包} \\times 5 \\text{ 美元/包} = 5 \\text{ 美元}\\)  \n- 每位客户的总支出是：  \n  \\(4 \\text{ 美元} + 5 \\text{ 美元} = 9 \\text{ 美元}\\)  \n\n金姆有 3 位客户，所以他的总支出是：  \n\\(3 \\text{ 客户} \\times 9 \\text{ 美元/客户} = 27 \\text{ 美元}\\)  \n\n他的总收入是 92 美元，因此他的利润是：  \n\\(92 \\text{ 美元} - 27 \\text{ 美元} = 65 \\text{ 美元}\\)  \n\n所以金姆每周将获得 65 美元的利润。  \n65  \n\nEnglish Answer  \nFirst, we need to calculate Kim's total expenses.  \nEach client requires the following costs for bleach and cloths:  \n- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach, and each bottle costs $2, so the cost for bleach is:  \n  \\(2 \\text{ bottles} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/bottle} = 4 \\text{ dollars}\\)  \n- Each client needs 1 pack of cloths, and the cost for cloths is:  \n  \\(1 \\text{ pack} \\times 5 \\text{ dollars/pack} = 5 \\text{ dollars}\\)  \n- The total expense per client is:  \n  \\(4 \\text{ dollars} + 5 \\text{ dollars} = 9 \\text{ dollars}\\)  \n\nKim has 3 clients, so his total expenses are:  \n\\(3 \\text{ clients} \\times 9 \\text{ dollars/client} = 27 \\text{ dollars}\\)  \n\nHis total income is $92, so his profit is:  \n\\(92 \\text{ dollars} - 27 \\text{ dollars} = 65 \\text{ dollars}\\)  \n\nTherefore, Kim will make a profit of $65 each week.  \n65  \n\nCompare Answer  \nBoth answers are the same: 65.

Steve lives farther away than Tim, so he is allowed to ride a bicycle. Steve lives 3 miles from school, and he rides his bicycle at a speed of 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles from school. If Tim can ride his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait at home before the loser finishes the race? Please output the answer at the end, and the output must only be a number in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer\n首先，我们需要计算史蒂夫和蒂姆回家的时间。\n\n史蒂夫的距离是3英里，转换为英尺：\n3英里 = 3 * 5280 = 15840英尺。\n\n史蒂夫骑自行车的速度是440英尺/分钟，因此他回家的时间为：\n时间 = 距离 / 速度 = 15840 / 440 = 36分钟。\n\n蒂姆的距离是2英里，转换为英尺：\n2英里 = 2 * 5280 = 10560英尺。\n\n蒂姆骑滑板的速度是264英尺/分钟，因此他回家的时间为：\n时间 = 距离 / 速度 = 10560 / 264 = 40分钟。\n\n获胜者是史蒂夫，他在蒂姆到达之前会等：\n等候时间 = 蒂姆的时间 - 史蒂夫的时间 = 40 - 36 = 4分钟。\n\n因此，史蒂夫将在家里等4分钟。\n\n4\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, we need to calculate the time it takes for Steve and Tim to get home.\n\nSteve's distance is 3 miles, which converts to feet:\n3 miles = 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet.\n\nSteve rides his bicycle at a speed of 440 feet per minute, so his time to get home is:\nTime = Distance / Speed = 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes.\n\nTim's distance is 2 miles, which converts to feet:\n2 miles = 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet.\n\nTim rides his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute, so his time to get home is:\nTime = Distance / Speed = 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes.\n\nThe winner is Steve, and he will wait at home before Tim arrives:\nWaiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 - 36 = 4 minutes.\n\nTherefore, Steve will wait for 4 minutes at home.\n\n4\n\nCompare Answer\nBoth answers are the same: 4 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer\n4",

She decided the best way to charge was by the tire. The cost for inflating each tire is 25 cents. On the first day, 5 people came with bicycles to inflate each of their tires. 3 people came to inflate all the tires on their tricycles. Finally, one person actually came riding a unicycle. How much money did she make that day? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output should only contain numbers, and the numbers must be in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer\n首先，我们来计算每种类型的自行车的轮胎数量。\n\n1. 双轮自行车：每辆有 2 个轮胎，5 个人骑着双轮自行车，所以总共有：\n   5 * 2 = 10 个轮胎。\n\n2. 三轮车：每辆有 3 个轮胎，3 个人骑着三轮车，所以总共有：\n   3 * 3 = 9 个轮胎。\n\n3. 独轮车：每辆有 1 个轮胎，1 个人骑着独轮车，所以总共有：\n   1 * 1 = 1 个轮胎。\n\n现在，我们将所有的轮胎数量加在一起：\n10 + 9 + 1 = 20 个轮胎。\n\n每个轮胎的费用是 25 美分，所以总收入为：\n20 * 0.25 = 5 美元。\n\n因此，Shawnda 那天赚了 5 美元。\n5\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, let's calculate the number of tires for each type of bicycle.\n\n1. Bicycles: Each has 2 tires, and 5 people came with bicycles, so the total number of tires is:\n   5 * 2 = 10 tires.\n\n2. Tricycles: Each has 3 tires, and 3 people came with tricycles, so the total number of tires is:\n   3 * 3 = 9 tires.\n\n3. Unicycle: Each has 1 tire, and 1 person came with a unicycle, so the total number of tires is:\n   1 * 1 = 1 tire.\n\nNow, let's add up the total number of tires:\n10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.\n\nThe cost for inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total earnings are:\n20 * 0.25 = 5 dollars.\n\nTherefore, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day.\n5\n\nCompare Answer\nThe answers from both languages are the same, both stating that Shawnda made 5 dollars.

    "output": "Chinese Problem  \n比尔每天烤制 300 个面包卷、120 个巧克力羊角面包和 60 个法棍。每个面包卷长 4 英寸，每个羊角面包长 6 英寸，每个法棍长 2 英尺。如果比尔把所有烘焙的食品首尾相连，它们总共会有多少英尺长？\n\nEnglish Problem  \nBill bakes 300 dinner rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes every day. Each dinner roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is 2 feet long. If Bill lines up all the baked goods end to end, how many feet long will they be in total?\n\nChinese Answer  \n首先，我们需要计算每种面包的总长度。\n\n1. 面包卷的总长度：\n   - 每个面包卷长 4 英寸，300 个面包卷的总长度为：\n   \\[\n   300 \\times 4 = 1200 \\text{ 英寸}\n   \\]\n\n2. 巧克力羊角面包的总长度：\n   - 每个羊角面包长 6 英寸，120 个羊角面包的总长度为：\n   \\[\n   120 \\times 6 = 720 \\text{ 英寸}\n   \\]\n\n3. 法棍的总长度：\n   - 每个法棍长 2 英尺，60 个法棍的总长度为：\n   \\[\n   60 \\times 2 = 120 \\text{ 英尺}\n   \\]\n   - 将法棍的长度转换为英寸（1 英尺 = 12 英寸）：\n   \\[\n   120 \\text{ 英尺} = 120 \\times 12 = 1440 \\text{ 英寸}\n   \\]\n\n接下来，我们将所有面包的总长度相加：\n\\[\n1200 \\text{ 英寸} + 720 \\text{ 英寸} + 1440 \\text{ 英寸} = 3360 \\text{ 英寸}\n\\]\n\n最后，将总长度从英寸转换为英尺（1 英尺 = 12 英寸）：\n\\[\n\\frac{3360 \\text{ 英寸}}{12} = 280 \\text{ 英尺}\n\\]\n\n因此，比尔烘焙的所有食品首尾相连的总长度为 280 英尺。\n280\n\nEnglish Answer  \nFirst, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good.\n\n1. Total length of dinner rolls:\n   - Each dinner roll is 4 inches long, so the total length for 300 dinner rolls is:\n   \\[\n   300 \\times 4 = 1200 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. Total length of chocolate croissants:\n   - Each croissant is 6 inches long, so the total length for 120 croissants is:\n   \\[\n   120 \\times 6 = 720 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. Total length of baguettes:\n   - Each baguette is 2 feet long, so the total length for 60 baguettes is:\n   \\[\n   60 \\times 2 = 120 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n   - Convert the length of baguettes to inches (1 foot = 12 inches):\n   \\[\n   120 \\text{ feet} = 120 \\times 12 = 1440 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nNext, we add the total lengths of all the baked goods:\n\\[\n1200 \\text{ inches} + 720 \\text{ inches} + 1440 \\text{ inches} = 3360 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nFinally, convert the total length from inches to feet (1 foot = 12 inches):\n\\[\n\\frac{3360 \\text{ inches}}{12} = 280 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total length of all the baked goods lined up end to end is 280 feet.\n280\n\nCompare Answer  \nThe answers from both the Chinese and English problems are the same: 280.

    "output": "Chinese Problem  \n如果一袋弹珠的价格是 20 美元，并且价格每两个月上涨原价的 20%，那么在 36 个月后，一袋弹珠的价格是多少？\n\nEnglish Problem  \nIf a bag of marbles costs $20, and the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, what will be the price of a bag of marbles after 36 months?\n\nChinese Answer  \n首先，计算在 36 个月内的时间段。36 个月等于 18 个两个月的周期。  \n每个周期价格上涨 20% 的原价，即 20 美元的 20% 是 4 美元。  \n因此，每个周期后价格为：20 + 4 = 24 美元。  \n接下来，计算每个周期后价格的变化。  \n1. 第一个周期：24 美元  \n2. 第二个周期：24 + 4 = 28 美元  \n3. 第三个周期：28 + 4 = 32 美元  \n4. 第四个周期：32 + 4 = 36 美元  \n5. 第五个周期：36 + 4 = 40 美元  \n6. 第六个周期：40 + 4 = 44 美元  \n7. 第七个周期：44 + 4 = 48 美元  \n8. 第八个周期：48 + 4 = 52 美元  \n9. 第九个周期：52 + 4 = 56 美元  \n10. 第十个周期：56 + 4 = 60 美元  \n11. 第十一个周期：60 + 4 = 64 美元  \n12. 第十二个周期：64 + 4 = 68 美元  \n13. 第十三个周期：68 + 4 = 72 美元  \n14. 第十四个周期：72 + 4 = 76 美元  \n15. 第十五个周期：76 + 4 = 80 美元  \n16. 第十六个周期：80 + 4 = 84 美元  \n17. 第十七个周期：84 + 4 = 88 美元  \n18. 第十八个周期：88 + 4 = 92 美元  \n\n所以，36 个月后，一袋弹珠的价格是 92 美元。  \n92\n\nEnglish Answer  \nFirst, calculate the number of two-month periods in 36 months. There are 18 two-month periods in 36 months.  \nThe price increases by 20% of the original price ($20) every two months, which is $4.  \nThus, the price after each period is: $20 + $4 = $24.  \nNext, calculate the price change after each period.  \n1. First period: $24  \n2. Second period: $24 + $4 = $28  \n3. Third period: $28 + $4 = $32  \n4. Fourth period: $32 + $4 = $36  \n5. Fifth period: $36 + $4 = $40  \n6. Sixth period: $40 + $4 = $44  \n7. Seventh period: $44 + $4 = $48  \n8. Eighth period: $48 + $4 = $52  \n9. Ninth period: $52 + $4 = $56  \n10. Tenth period: $56 + $4 = $60  \n11. Eleventh period: $60 + $4 = $64  \n12. Twelfth period: $64 + $4 = $68  \n13. Thirteenth period: $68 + $4 = $72  \n14. Fourteenth period: $72 + $4 = $76  \n15. Fifteenth period: $76 + $4 = $80  \n16. Sixteenth period: $80 + $4 = $84  \n17. Seventeenth period: $84 + $4 = $88  \n18. Eighteenth period: $88 + $4 = $92  \n\nSo, after 36 months, the price of a bag of marbles is $92.  \n92\n\nCompare Answer  \nThe answers are the same: both calculations show that the price after 36 months is $92. The processes are also identical in structure and reasoning.\n\nFinal Answer  \n92",

To make a Spanish cream cake, she needs 3 eggs. If Sandra's task is to make 15 Spanish cream cakes for her school's fundraising event, how many times must Sandra babysit? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output must only be a number in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer  \n首先，我们需要计算桑德拉制作15个西班牙奶油蛋糕所需的鸡蛋总数。每个蛋糕需要3颗鸡蛋，因此15个蛋糕需要的鸡蛋总数为：  \n15 × 3 = 45颗鸡蛋。\n\n接下来，我们知道每次桑德拉当临时保姆可以得到9颗鸡蛋。为了计算桑德拉需要当多少次临时保姆，我们将总鸡蛋数除以每次得到的鸡蛋数：  \n45 ÷ 9 = 5次。\n\n因此，桑德拉必须当5次临时保姆。  \n5\n\nEnglish Answer  \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Sandra needs to make 15 Spanish cream cakes. Each cake requires 3 eggs, so for 15 cakes, the total number of eggs needed is:  \n15 × 3 = 45 eggs.\n\nNext, we know that each time Sandra babysits, she receives 9 eggs. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs she gets each time:  \n45 ÷ 9 = 5 times.\n\nTherefore, Sandra must babysit 5 times.  \n5\n\nCompare Answer  \nBoth the Chinese and English answers indicate that Sandra must babysit 5 times to gather enough eggs for the cakes. The processes in both languages are consistent and lead to the same conclusion.\n\nFinal Answer  \n5",

In two years, the sum of their ages will be 28 years. How old is Seth this year? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output must only be a number in Arabic numeral format.  \n\nChinese Answer  \n设布鲁克的年龄为x岁，则塞思的年龄为2x岁。两年后，布鲁克的年龄为x + 2岁，塞思的年龄为2x + 2岁。根据题意，两年后他们的年龄总和为28岁，可以列出方程：  \n(x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 28  \n化简方程：  \n3x + 4 = 28  \n3x = 24  \nx = 8  \n所以布鲁克今年8岁，塞思今年2x = 16岁。  \n因此，塞思今年16岁。  \n16  \n\nEnglish Answer  \nLet Brooke's age be x years, then Seth's age is 2x years. In two years, Brooke's age will be x + 2 years, and Seth's age will be 2x + 2 years. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in two years will be 28 years, which gives us the equation:  \n(x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 28  \nSimplifying the equation:  \n3x + 4 = 28  \n3x = 24  \nx = 8  \nSo, Brooke is 8 years old this year, and Seth is 2x = 16 years old.  \nTherefore, Seth is 16 years old this year.  \n16  \n\nCompare Answer  \nBoth answers are the same: 16.

How many miles does he walk in a week? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output should only contain a number in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer  \n潘喬每天步行 20 英里，周一到周五有 5 天，所以他在工作日的總步行距離為：  \n20 英里/天 × 5 天 = 100 英里。  \n在周末，他每天步行 10 英里，周末有 2 天，所以他在周末的總步行距離為：  \n10 英里/天 × 2 天 = 20 英里。  \n因此，他一周的總步行距離為：  \n100 英里 + 20 英里 = 120 英里。  \n所以，潘喬一周步行的總距離是 120 英里。  \n120\n\nEnglish Answer  \nPan Qiao walks 20 miles every day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. Therefore, the total distance he walks during the weekdays is:  \n20 miles/day × 5 days = 100 miles.  \nOn the weekends, he walks 10 miles each day for 2 days, so the total distance he walks on the weekends is:  \n10 miles/day × 2 days = 20 miles.  \nThus, his total walking distance for the week is:  \n100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles.  \nSo, Pan Qiao walks a total of 120 miles in a week.  \n120\n\nCompare Answer  \nThe answers from both the Chinese and English problems are the same, both yielding 120 miles.

    "output": "Chinese Problem\n守车上有四只鸟。莎莉二号比瑞德奶奶大三岁。瑞德奶奶的年龄是莎莉四号的两倍。如果莎莉四号和莎莉三十二号一样大，而莎莉三十二号八岁，那么四只鸟一共多少岁？請在輸出的最後輸出答案，最後的輸出只能有數字，數字必須為阿拉伯數字的格式。\n\nEnglish Problem\nThere are four birds on the car. Sally No. 2 is three years older than Grandma Reed. Grandma Reed's age is twice that of Sally No. 4. If Sally No. 4 is the same age as Sally No. 32, and Sally No. 32 is eight years old, how old are the four birds in total? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output can only be a number, and the number must be in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer\n首先，我们知道莎莉三十二号的年龄是8岁，因此莎莉四号的年龄也是8岁（因为莎莉四号和莎莉三十二号一样大）。接下来，瑞德奶奶的年龄是莎莉四号的两倍，所以瑞德奶奶的年龄是8 * 2 = 16岁。莎莉二号比瑞德奶奶大3岁，因此莎莉二号的年龄是16 + 3 = 19岁。现在我们知道四只鸟的年龄分别是：莎莉二号（19岁）、瑞德奶奶（16岁）、莎莉四号（8岁）和最后一只鸟的年龄未知。由于题目没有提供最后一只鸟的年龄，我们假设最后一只鸟的年龄为0岁。四只鸟的总年龄是19 + 16 + 8 + 0 = 43岁。\n\n43\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, we know that Sally No. 32 is 8 years old, so Sally No. 4 is also 8 years old (since Sally No. 4 is the same age as Sally No. 32). Next, Grandma Reed's age is twice that of Sally No. 4, so Grandma Reed is 8 * 2 = 16 years old. Sally No. 2 is three years older than Grandma Reed, so Sally No. 2 is 16 + 3 = 19 years old. Now we know the ages of the four birds: Sally No. 2 (19 years), Grandma Reed (16 years), Sally No. 4 (8 years), and the age of the last bird is unknown. Since the problem does not provide the age of the last bird, we assume the last bird's age is 0 years. The total age of the four birds is 19 + 16 + 8 + 0 = 43 years.\n\n43\n\nCompare Answer\nThe answers from both languages are the same, both yielding a total age of 43 years for the four birds. The processes followed in both languages are identical, leading to the same conclusion.\n\nFinal Answer\n43",

It's a big event, so he needs to handle 60 potatoes. The potatoes are about the same size, so the time it takes to peel and cut each potato is roughly the same. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel one potato, and cutting it into pieces takes about 5 seconds. How long will it take Billy to prepare these potatoes?\n\nChinese Answer\n首先，我们计算削皮和切块每颗土豆所需的总时间。削皮一颗土豆需要1分30秒，即90秒，切块一颗土豆需要5秒。因此，每颗土豆的总时间为：\n\n90秒 + 5秒 = 95秒\n\n接下来，我们计算处理60颗土豆所需的总时间：\n\n95秒 × 60 = 5700秒\n\n最后，将5700秒转换为小时和分钟：\n\n5700秒 ÷ 60 = 95分钟\n\n所以，比利准备好这些土豆需要95分钟。\n\n95\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, we calculate the total time required to peel and cut each potato.

If their profit is $25, how much did they spend on lemons? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output should only contain numbers in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer  \n首先，我们需要计算出每加仑柠檬水的总成本。每加仑的成本是3美元（买柠檬）+ 2美元（买糖）= 5美元。  \n每加仑能制作20杯，每杯售价0.50美元，因此每加仑的收入是20杯 × 0.50美元/杯 = 10美元。  \n利润是收入减去成本，因此利润 = 收入 - 成本。  \n设制作x加仑柠檬水，利润为25美元：  \n10x - 5x = 25  \n5x = 25  \nx = 5  \n所以，他们制作了5加仑柠檬水。  \n他们在柠檬上的花费是：  \n每加仑的柠檬成本是3美元，5加仑的柠檬成本是3美元 × 5 = 15美元。  \n\n15  \nChinese Final Answer  \n15\n\nEnglish Answer  \nFirst, we need to calculate the total cost for each gallon of lemonade. The cost per gallon is $3 (for lemons) + $2 (for sugar) = $5.  \nEach gallon makes 20 cups, and each cup sells for $0.50, so the revenue per gallon is 20 cups × $0.50/cup = $10.  \nProfit is revenue minus cost, so profit = revenue - cost.  \nLet x be the number of gallons made, and the profit is $25:  \n10x - 5x = 25  \n5x = 25  \nx = 5  \nSo, they made 5 gallons of lemonade.  \nThe amount spent on lemons is:  \nThe cost of lemons per gallon is $3, and for 5 gallons, the cost is $3 × 5 = $15.  \n\n15  \nEnglish Final Answer  \n15\n\nCompare Answer  \nBoth answers are the same, and the processes followed in both languages are identical.\n\nFinal Answer  \n15",

    "output": "Chinese Problem\n两支田径队在一场 4x400 米的接力赛上进行比赛。在这场比赛中，每支参赛队伍有 4 名队员，每个队员跑 400 米或绕着标准赛道跑一圈。其中一队非常整齐，每位队员跑完 400 米的赛段精确到 55 秒。另一队比较不整齐，第一位选手用 60 秒跑完 400 米的赛段，然后后面每位选手都比前一位选手快 3 秒。根据这些信息，跑得比较快的参赛队多赢了几秒？\n\nEnglish Problem\nTwo track and field teams are competing in a 4x400 meter relay race. In this race, each team has 4 members, and each member runs 400 meters or one lap around a standard track. One team is very consistent, with each member completing their 400-meter leg in exactly 55 seconds. The other team is less consistent, with the first runner completing their 400-meter leg in 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner running 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Based on this information, how many seconds did the faster team win by?\n\nChinese Answer\n首先，我们计算第一支队伍的总时间。每位队员都用 55 秒完成 400 米的赛段，因此总时间为：\n55 秒 × 4 = 220 秒。\n\n接下来，我们计算第二支队伍的总时间。第一位选手用 60 秒，第二位选手用 57 秒，第三位选手用 54 秒，第四位选手用 51 秒。因此，总时间为：\n60 秒 + 57 秒 + 54 秒 + 51 秒 = 222 秒。\n\n最后，我们计算两队之间的时间差：\n222 秒 - 220 秒 = 2 秒。\n\n因此，跑得比较快的参赛队多赢了 2 秒。\n2\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, we calculate the total time for the first team. Each member runs their 400-meter leg in exactly 55 seconds, so the total time is:\n55 seconds × 4 = 220 seconds.\n\nNext, we calculate the total time for the second team. The first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds, the third runner takes 54 seconds, and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds. Therefore, the total time is:\n60 seconds + 57 seconds + 54 seconds + 51 seconds = 222 seconds.\n\nFinally, we find the time difference between the two teams:\n222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.\n\nThus, the faster team won by 2 seconds.\n2\n\nCompare Answer\nThe answers from both the Chinese and English problems are the same, both indicating that the faster team won by 2 seconds. The processes used to arrive at the answers are also consistent in both languages.\n\nFinal Answer\n2",

What is the difference in probability (expressed as a percentage) between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two consecutive even numbers? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output should only be a number in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer  \n首先，我们计算掷出一个大于 3 的数字的概率。六面骰子上的数字是 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6。大于 3 的数字是 4, 5, 6，因此大于 3 的数字的数量为 3。  \n所以掷出一个大于 3 的数字的概率为：  \n\\[ P(>3) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \\]  \n\n接下来，我们计算连续掷出两个偶数的概率。六面骰子上的偶数是 2, 4, 6。掷出一个偶数的概率为：  \n\\[ P(偶数) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \\]  \n连续掷出两个偶数的概率为：  \n\\[ P(偶数, 偶数) = P(偶数) \\times P(偶数) = 0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.25 \\]  \n\n现在，我们计算两者的差异：  \n\\[ 差异 = P(>3) - P(偶数, 偶数) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \\]  \n\n最后，将差异转换为百分比：  \n\\[ 差异的百分比 = 0.25 \\times 100\\% = 25\\% \\]  \n\n因此，杰瑞掷出一个大于 3 的数字的可能性比连续掷出两个偶数的可能性大 25%。  \n25\n\nEnglish Answer  \nFirst, we calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6, so there are 3 numbers greater than 3.  \nThus, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:  \n\\[ P(>3) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \\]  \n\nNext, we calculate the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number is:  \n\\[ P(even) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \\]  \nThe probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers is:  \n\\[ P(even, even) = P(even) \\times P(even) = 0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.25 \\]  \n\nNow, we calculate the difference between the two probabilities:  \n\\[ Difference = P(>3) - P(even, even) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \\]  \n\nFinally, we convert the difference to a percentage:  \n\\[ Difference in percentage = 0.25 \\times 100\\% = 25\\% \\]  \n\nTherefore, Jerry's probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% greater than the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers.  \n25\n\nCompare Answer  \nBoth answers are the same, with a final answer of 25.\n\nFinal Answer  \n25",

The mice are kept in 3 cages, with each mouse receiving 6 straws. The hamsters are kept separately in 10 cages, with each hamster receiving 5 straws.

If 160 straws are distributed to the small rodents, how many mice are there in each cage? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output must only be a number in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer\n首先，我们需要计算老鼠、仓鼠和兔子所需的秸秆总量。\n\n1. 老鼠的秸秆需求：\n   - 假设每个笼子里有 \\( x \\) 只老鼠。\n   - 3 个笼子总共的老鼠数量为 \\( 3x \\)。\n   - 每只老鼠分到 6 根秸秆，因此老鼠总共需要的秸秆为 \\( 3x \\times 6 = 18x \\)。\n\n2. 仓鼠的秸秆需求：\n   - 10 个笼子，每只仓鼠分到 5 根秸秆。\n   - 假设每个笼子里有 \\( y \\) 只仓鼠。\n   - 仓鼠总共需要的秸秆为 \\( 10y \\times 5 = 50y \\)。\n\n3. 兔子的秸秆需求：\n   - 兔子总共分到 20 根秸秆。\n\n4. 总秸秆需求：\n   - 总共的秸秆为 \\( 18x + 50y + 20 = 160 \\)。\n\n5. 现在我们可以简化这个方程：\n   \\[\n   18x + 50y + 20 = 160\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   18x + 50y = 140\n   \\]\n\n6. 为了找出 \\( x \\) 和 \\( y \\) 的关系，我们可以尝试不同的 \\( y \\) 值。假设 \\( y = 0 \\)（没有仓鼠），我们可以得到：\n   \\[\n   18x = 140 \\implies x = \\frac{140}{18} \\approx 7.78 \\quad (\\text{不合适})\n   \\]\n   假设 \\( y = 1 \\)：\n   \\[\n   18x + 50 = 140 \\implies 18x = 90 \\implies x = 5\n   \\]\n   假设 \\( y = 2 \\)：\n   \\[\n   18x + 100 = 140 \\implies 18x = 40 \\implies x = \\frac{40}{18} \\approx 2.22 \\quad (\\text{不合适})\n   \\]\n   假设 \\( y = 3 \\)：\n   \\[\n   18x + 150 = 140 \\implies 18x = -10 \\quad (\\text{不合适})\n   \\]\n\n   通过尝试，我们发现 \\( y = 1 \\) 时，\\( x = 5 \\) 是合适的。\n\n因此，每个笼子里有 5 只老鼠。\n\n5\nChinese Final Answer\n5\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, we need to calculate the total straw required for the mice, hamsters, and rabbits.\n\n1. Straw requirement for mice:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of mice in each cage.\n   - The total number of mice in 3 cages is \\( 3x \\).\n   - Each mouse receives 6 straws, so the total straw needed for mice is \\( 3x \\times 6 = 18x \\).\n\n2. Straw requirement for hamsters:\n   - There are 10 cages, and each hamster receives 5 straws.\n   - Let \\( y \\) be the number of hamsters in each cage.\n   - The total straw needed for hamsters is \\( 10y \\times 5 = 50y \\).\n\n3. Straw requirement for rabbits:\n   - The rabbits received a total of 20 straws.\n\n4. Total straw requirement:\n   - The total straw is \\( 18x + 50y + 20 = 160 \\).\n\n5. Now we can simplify this equation:\n   \\[\n   18x + 50y + 20 = 160\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   18x + 50y = 140\n   \\]\n\n6. To find the relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), we can try different values for \\( y \\). Assuming \\( y = 0 \\) (no hamsters), we get:\n   \\[\n   18x = 140 \\implies x = \\frac{140}{18} \\approx 7.78 \\quad (\\text{not suitable})\n   \\]\n   Assuming \\( y = 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   18x + 50 = 140 \\implies 18x = 90 \\implies x = 5\n   \\]\n   Assuming \\( y = 2 \\):\n   \\[\n   18x + 100 = 140 \\implies 18x = 40 \\implies x = \\frac{40}{18} \\approx 2.22 \\quad (\\text{not suitable})\n   \\]\n   Assuming \\( y = 3 \\):\n   \\[\n   18x + 150 = 140 \\implies 18x = -10 \\quad (\\text{not suitable})\n   \\]\n\n   Through trial, we find that when \\( y = 1 \\), \\( x = 5 \\) is suitable.\n\nThus, there are 5 mice in each cage.\n\n5\nEnglish Final Answer\n5\n\nCompare Answer\nThe answers from both languages are the same: 5.

A pencil costs $1.20, and an eraser costs $0.30. How much do 8 fountain pens cost?\n\nChinese Answer  \n首先，我们需要计算一支钢笔的价格。根据题目，一支钢笔的价格等于一支铅笔和一块橡皮的总价。  \n铅笔的价格是 1.20 美元，橡皮的价格是 0.30 美元。  \n所以，一支钢笔的价格 = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 美元。  \n\n接下来，我们计算 8 支钢笔的总价格：  \n8 支钢笔的价格 = 8 × 1.50 = 12.00 美元。  \n\n因此，8 支钢笔的价格是 12.00 美元。  \n{Chinese Final Answer}  \n12.00\n\nEnglish Answer  \nFirst, we need to calculate the price of one fountain pen. According to the problem, the price of a fountain pen is equal to the total price of a pencil and an eraser.  \nThe price of a pencil is $1.20, and the price of an eraser is $0.30.  \nSo, the price of one fountain pen = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 dollars.  \n\nNext, we calculate the total price for 8 fountain pens:  \nThe price for 8 fountain pens = 8 × 1.50 = 12.00 dollars.  \n\nTherefore, the cost of 8 fountain pens is 12.00 dollars.  \n{English Final Answer}  \n12.00\n\nCompare Answer  \nBoth answers are the same: 12.00.

The award includes a one-time cash bonus of $5,000 and a 5% raise. If he earns $2,000 per week (every week of the year), and he wins the award on the first day of the year, how much does he earn in total for that year?\n\nChinese Answer\n首先，我们计算约翰在获奖前的收入。他每周赚 2,000 美元，一年有 52 周，所以他在一年中的前 1 周（获奖前）赚取的总收入为：\n2,000 美元/周 × 1 周 = 2,000 美元。\n\n接下来，我们计算他在获奖后的收入。获奖后，他的工资增加了 5%。因此，他的新周薪为：\n2,000 美元 × (1 + 5%) = 2,000 美元 × 1.05 = 2,100 美元。\n\n在获奖后的 51 周中，他的收入为：\n2,100 美元/周 × 51 周 = 107,100 美元。\n\n最后，我们将获奖的现金奖励 5,000 美元加到他的总收入中：\n2,000 美元（获奖前） + 107,100 美元（获奖后） + 5,000 美元（现金奖励） = 114,100 美元。\n\n因此，约翰在这一年赚了 114,100 美元。\n114100\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, we calculate John's income before the award. He earns $2,000 per week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, so his total income for the first week (before the award) is:\n$2,000/week × 1 week = $2,000.\n\nNext, we calculate his income after the award. After winning the award, his salary increases by 5%. Therefore, his new weekly salary is:\n$2,000 × (1 + 5%) = $2,000 × 1.05 = $2,100.\n\nFor the remaining 51 weeks, his income will be:\n$2,100/week × 51 weeks = $107,100.\n\nFinally, we add the one-time cash bonus of $5,000 to his total income:\n$2,000 (before the award) + $107,100 (after the award) + $5,000 (cash bonus) = $114,100.\n\nThus, John earns a total of $114,100 for the year.\n114100\n\nCompare Answer\nThe answers from both the Chinese and English problems are the same: 114100. The processes used to arrive at the answers are also consistent, with both calculations considering the initial income, the raise, and the cash bonus.\n\nFinal Answer\n114100",

He has had cheese omelets for breakfast on 3 days this week, with each omelet using 1 slice more cheese than each sandwich. He made a large batch of macaroni and cheese for several dinners this week, using 8 slices of cheese in it. How many slices of cheese did he use in total? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output should only be a number in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer\n首先，我们计算卡尔这周午餐吃的三明治所用的奶酪片数：\n- 每天吃三明治，使用 2 片奶酪。\n- 一周有 7 天，所以三明治的总片数为：2 片/天 × 7 天 = 14 片。\n\n接下来，我们计算他早餐吃的煎蛋卷所用的奶酪片数：\n- 他在这周的 3 天吃奶酪和煎蛋卷，每份煎蛋卷比三明治多 1 片奶酪，所以每份煎蛋卷使用 2 + 1 = 3 片奶酪。\n- 煎蛋卷的总片数为：3 片/天 × 3 天 = 9 片。\n\n最后，我们加上他做的奶酪通心粉所用的奶酪片数：\n- 奶酪通心粉使用了 8 片奶酪。\n\n现在，我们将所有的奶酪片数加在一起：\n14 片（三明治） + 9 片（煎蛋卷） + 8 片（通心粉） = 31 片。\n\n因此，卡尔这一周总共使用了 31 片奶酪。\n31\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, we calculate the number of slices of cheese Carl used for sandwiches for lunch:\n- He eats sandwiches every day, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.\n- There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of slices for sandwiches is: 2 slices/day × 7 days = 14 slices.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of slices of cheese he used for omelets for breakfast:\n- He had cheese omelets for breakfast on 3 days this week, with each omelet using 1 slice more cheese than each sandwich, so each omelet uses 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese.\n- The total number of slices for omelets is: 3 slices/day × 3 days = 9 slices.\n\nFinally, we add the number of slices used in the macaroni and cheese:\n- The macaroni and cheese used 8 slices of cheese.\n\nNow, we add all the slices of cheese together:\n14 slices (sandwiches) + 9 slices (omelets) + 8 slices (macaroni) = 31 slices.\n\nTherefore, Carl used a total of 31 slices of cheese this week.\n31\n\nCompare Answer\nThe answers from both languages are the same: 31.

Please output only a number at the end, and the number must be in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer\n首先，我们计算布林利前五场考试的总分：\n89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438\n\n接下来，我们需要计算去掉最低分后的平均分。前五场考试的最低分是71，所以去掉71后，剩下的分数是：\n89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367\n\n假设第六场考试的分数为x。去掉最低分后，布林利的总分为：\n367 + x\n\n为了达到平均分93，布林利的总分需要满足以下条件：\n(367 + x) / 5 = 93\n\n解这个方程：\n367 + x = 93 * 5\n367 + x = 465\nx = 465 - 367\nx = 98\n\n所以，布林利在第六场考试中需要考到的分数是98。\n\n98\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, we calculate Brinley's total score from the first five exams:\n89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438\n\nNext, we need to find the average score after dropping the lowest score. The lowest score from the first five exams is 71, so the remaining scores are:\n89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367\n\nLet x be the score Brinley needs on the sixth exam. After dropping the lowest score, her total score will be:\n367 + x\n\nTo achieve an average of 93, Brinley's total score must satisfy the following condition:\n(367 + x) / 5 = 93\n\nSolving this equation:\n367 + x = 93 * 5\n367 + x = 465\nx = 465 - 367\nx = 98\n\nThus, the score Brinley needs on the sixth exam is 98.\n\n98\n\nCompare Answer\nBoth answers are the same, and the processes followed to arrive at the answers are identical.\n\nFinal Answer\n98",

The jacket she wants costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Sara babysat her neighbor's kids 4 times, earning $5 each time. Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara already saved $10 before she started babysitting, how many times does she need to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output must be in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer\n首先，我们计算萨拉想要购买的夹克和鞋子的总费用。夹克的价格是30美元，两双鞋的价格是2 * 20 = 40美元。因此，总费用为30 + 40 = 70美元。\n\n接下来，我们计算萨拉通过照看孩子赚到的钱。她照看了4次，每次赚5美元，所以她总共赚了4 * 5 = 20美元。\n\n她在开始照看孩子之前已经存了10美元，所以她现在总共有10 + 20 = 30美元。\n\n为了计算她还需要多少钱来购买夹克和鞋子，我们用总费用减去她现在拥有的金额：70 - 30 = 40美元。\n\n最后，我们计算她需要修剪多少次草坪来赚取这40美元。每次修剪草坪她能赚4美元，所以她需要修剪的次数为40 / 4 = 10次。\n\n因此，萨拉需要修剪10次草坪才能买得起夹克和鞋。\n\n10\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes that Sara wants to buy. The jacket costs $30, and the cost for two pairs of shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. Therefore, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.\n\nNext, we calculate how much money Sara earned from babysitting. She babysat 4 times, earning $5 each time, so she earned a total of 4 * $5 = $20.\n\nBefore she started babysitting, she had already saved $10, so now she has a total of $10 + $20 = $30.\n\nTo find out how much more money she needs to buy the jacket and shoes, we subtract the amount she currently has from the total cost: $70 - $30 = $40.\n\nFinally, we calculate how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn that $40. She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so the number of times she needs to mow is $40 / $4 = 10 times.\n\nThus, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.\n\n10\n\nCompare Answer\nBoth answers are the same: 10. The processes followed in both languages are identical, leading to the same conclusion.\n\nFinal Answer\n10",

    "output": "Chinese Problem  \n杰瑞有一群鸡。红鸡每天下 3 个蛋，白鸡每天下 5 个蛋。杰瑞每天收集 42 个鸡蛋。如果他的白鸡比红鸡多两只，他有多少只红鸡？請在輸出的最後輸出答案，最後的輸出只能有數字，數字必須為阿拉伯數字的格式。\n\nEnglish Problem  \nJerry has a group of chickens. Red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, and white chickens lay 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output should only be a number in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer  \n设红鸡的数量为 \\( r \\)，白鸡的数量为 \\( w \\)。根据题意，白鸡比红鸡多两只，可以表示为：  \n\\[ w = r + 2 \\]  \n红鸡每天产蛋总数为 \\( 3r \\)，白鸡每天产蛋总数为 \\( 5w \\)。因此，  \n\\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \\]  \n将 \\( w \\) 的表达式代入到蛋的方程中：  \n\\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \\]  \n展开并简化：  \n\\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \\]  \n\\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \\]  \n\\[ 8r = 32 \\]  \n\\[ r = 4 \\]  \n所以，杰瑞有 4 只红鸡。  \n4\n\nEnglish Answer  \nLet the number of red chickens be \\( r \\) and the number of white chickens be \\( w \\). According to the problem, the number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens, which can be expressed as:  \n\\[ w = r + 2 \\]  \nThe total number of eggs produced by red chickens per day is \\( 3r \\), and the total number of eggs produced by white chickens per day is \\( 5w \\). Therefore,  \n\\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \\]  \nSubstituting the expression for \\( w \\) into the egg equation:  \n\\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \\]  \nExpanding and simplifying:  \n\\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \\]  \n\\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \\]  \n\\[ 8r = 32 \\]  \n\\[ r = 4 \\]  \nThus, Jerry has 4 red chickens.  \n4\n\nCompare Answer  \nBoth the Chinese and English answers indicate that Jerry has 4 red chickens, and the processes used to arrive at this conclusion are identical.\n\nFinal Answer  \n4",

If he walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour, how many hours does he take to walk around it? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output should only contain numbers in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer\n首先，我们需要计算公园的周长。公园的周长公式是：\n周长 = 2 × (长 + 宽)\n\n公园的长是 6 英里，宽是 1.5 英里，因此：\n周长 = 2 × (6 + 1.5) = 2 × 7.5 = 15 英里\n\n接下来，我们知道加里的步行速度是 3 英里/小时。我们可以用周长除以速度来计算他散步所需的时间：\n时间 = 周长 / 速度 = 15 / 3 = 5 小时\n\n因此，加里散步花了 5 小时。\n5\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:\nPerimeter = 2 × (length + width)\n\nThe length of the park is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, so:\nPerimeter = 2 × (6 + 1.5) = 2 × 7.5 = 15 miles\n\nNext, we know that Gary's walking speed is 3 miles per hour. We can use the perimeter divided by the speed to calculate the time he takes to walk around:\nTime = Perimeter / Speed = 15 / 3 = 5 hours\n\nTherefore, Gary takes 5 hours to walk around the park.\n5\n\nCompare Answer\nBoth the Chinese and English answers are the same, with both concluding that Gary takes 5 hours to walk around the park.\n\nFinal Answer\n5",

Four minutes ago, the amount of water in the large tank was twice that of the small tank. Now, the amount of water in the large tank is four times that of the small tank. How much water is currently in the small tank?\n\nChinese Answer\n设小水池现在的水量为 \\( x \\) 加仑。根据题意，大水池现在的水量为 \\( 4x \\) 加仑。由于水池以每分钟 4 加仑的速度漏水，4 分钟前大水池的水量为 \\( 4x + 16 \\) 加仑，小水池的水量为 \\( x + 16 \\) 加仑。根据题意，4 分钟前大水池的水量是小水池的两倍，因此可以列出方程：\n\n\\[\n4x + 16 = 2(x + 16)\n\\]\n\n解这个方程：\n\n\\[\n4x + 16 = 2x + 32\n\\]\n\\[\n4x - 2x = 32 - 16\n\\]\n\\[\n2x = 16\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 8\n\\]\n\n所以小水池现在有 8 加仑水。\n\n8\n\nEnglish Answer\nLet the current amount of water in the small tank be \\( x \\) gallons. According to the problem, the current amount of water in the large tank is \\( 4x \\) gallons. Since the tanks leak at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, four minutes ago, the amount of water in the large tank was \\( 4x + 16 \\) gallons, and the amount of water in the small tank was \\( x + 16 \\) gallons. The problem states that four minutes ago, the amount of water in the large tank was twice that of the small tank, leading to the equation:\n\n\\[\n4x + 16 = 2(x + 16)\n\\]\n\nSolving this equation:\n\n\\[\n4x + 16 = 2x + 32\n\\]\n\\[\n4x - 2x = 32 - 16\n\\]\n\\[\n2x = 16\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 8\n\\]\n\nThus, the small tank currently has 8 gallons of water.\n\n8\n\nCompare Answer\nBoth answers are the same, and the processes used to arrive at the answers are identical.\n\nFinal Answer\n8",

The processes followed in both languages are identical, leading to the same final answer.  \n\nFinal Answer  \n220",

Please output the answer at the end, and it should only be in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer\n首先，我们计算每辆车的总成本，包括税和注册费。\n\n1. 每辆车的售价是 20,000 美元。\n2. 税是 10%，所以每辆车的税是 20,000 * 10% = 2,000 美元。\n3. 每辆车的总成本是 20,000 + 2,000 = 22,000 美元。\n4. 注册费是 1,000 美元，所以每辆车的最终成本是 22,000 + 1,000 = 23,000 美元。\n5. 车队有 12 辆车，因此总花费是 23,000 * 12 = 276,000 美元。\n\n所以，马克为这一切花了 276,000 美元。\n276000\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, we calculate the total cost per car, including tax and registration fee.\n\n1. The price of each car is $20,000.\n2. The tax is 10%, so the tax per car is $20,000 * 10% = $2,000.\n3. The total cost per car is $20,000 + $2,000 = $22,000.\n4. The registration fee is $1,000, so the final cost per car is $22,000 + $1,000 = $23,000.\n5. There are 12 cars in the fleet, so the total expenditure is $23,000 * 12 = $276,000.\n\nTherefore, Mark spent a total of $276,000.\n276000\n\nCompare Answer\nThe answers from both the Chinese and English problems are the same: 276000.

Please output the answer at the end, and the final output should only be a number in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer  \n首先，史蒂夫每天吃 6 个番茄。他吃的是他女朋友的两倍，因此他女朋友每天吃的番茄数量为：  \n6 ÷ 2 = 3（个）  \n\n接下来，计算史蒂夫每周吃的番茄数量：  \n6 × 7 = 42（个）  \n\n然后，计算每根藤蔓每周能结的番茄数量：  \n1 根藤蔓每周结 3 个番茄。  \n\n最后，计算他需要多少根藤蔓：  \n42 ÷ 3 = 14（根）  \n\n因此，史蒂夫需要 14 根藤蔓。  \n14\n\nEnglish Answer  \nFirst, Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day. Since he eats twice as many as his girlfriend, we can find out how many tomatoes his girlfriend eats:  \n6 ÷ 2 = 3 (tomatoes)  \n\nNext, we calculate how many tomatoes Steve eats in a week:  \n6 × 7 = 42 (tomatoes)  \n\nThen, we know that one vine produces 3 tomatoes a week.  \n\nFinally, we calculate how many vines he needs:  \n42 ÷ 3 = 14 (vines)  \n\nTherefore, Steve needs 14 vines.  \n14\n\nCompare Answer  \nBoth the Chinese and English answers arrived at the same conclusion of 14 vines needed.

John's candies are twice that of Robert's. If John has 54 candies, how many more candies does John have than James? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output should only contain a number in Arabic numeral format.  \n\nChinese Answer  \n设罗伯特有 \\( x \\) 块糖果，则詹姆斯有 \\( x + 6 \\) 块糖果。约翰的糖果是罗伯特的两倍，所以约翰有 \\( 2x \\) 块糖果。根据题意，约翰有 54 块糖果，因此可以列出方程：  \n\\[ 2x = 54 \\]  \n解这个方程：  \n\\[ x = 27 \\]  \n所以罗伯特有 27 块糖果，詹姆斯有：  \n\\[ 27 + 6 = 33 \\]  \n约翰比詹姆斯多的糖果数量为：  \n\\[ 54 - 33 = 21 \\]  \n因此，约翰比詹姆斯多 21 块糖果。  \n21  \n\nEnglish Answer  \nLet \\( x \\) be the number of candies Robert has. Then James has \\( x + 6 \\) candies. John's candies are twice that of Robert's, so John has \\( 2x \\) candies. According to the problem, John has 54 candies, thus we can set up the equation:  \n\\[ 2x = 54 \\]  \nSolving for \\( x \\):  \n\\[ x = 27 \\]  \nSo Robert has 27 candies, and James has:  \n\\[ 27 + 6 = 33 \\]  \nThe number of candies John has more than James is:  \n\\[ 54 - 33 = 21 \\]  \nTherefore, John has 21 more candies than James.  \n21  \n\nCompare Answer  \nThe answers from both the Chinese and English problems are the same, both yielding 21.

    "output": "Chinese Problem  \n珍的化妆师每小时收费 250 美元。她参演的一部电影需要非常昂贵的化妆品，每天要花 6 个小时化妆，她一周要化妆 4 次。这部电影需要 5 周拍完。电影拍完后，化妆师给了珍 10% 的折扣，因为工作量很大。珍付了多少钱？請在輸出的最後輸出答案，最後的輸出只能有數字，數字必須為阿拉伯數字的格式。\n\nEnglish Problem  \nJing's makeup artist charges $250 per hour. The movie she is participating in requires very expensive cosmetics, and it takes 6 hours of makeup each day. She does makeup 4 times a week. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish. After the movie is completed, the makeup artist gives Jing a 10% discount because of the large workload. How much did Jing pay? Please output the answer at the end, and the final output should only be a number in Arabic numeral format.\n\nChinese Answer  \n首先，我们计算珍的化妆师在电影拍摄期间的总费用。  \n每小时收费为 250 美元，每天化妆 6 小时，因此每天的费用为：  \n250 美元/小时 × 6 小时 = 1500 美元/天  \n\n她一周化妆 4 次，所以每周的费用为：  \n1500 美元/天 × 4 次 = 6000 美元/周  \n\n电影拍摄需要 5 周，因此总费用为：  \n6000 美元/周 × 5 周 = 30000 美元  \n\n化妆师给了珍 10% 的折扣，因此折扣金额为：  \n30000 美元 × 10% = 3000 美元  \n\n最后，珍实际支付的金额为：  \n30000 美元 - 3000 美元 = 27000 美元  \n\n27000\n\nEnglish Answer  \nFirst, we calculate the total cost for Jing's makeup artist during the filming of the movie.  \nThe hourly rate is $250, and it takes 6 hours of makeup each day, so the daily cost is:  \n$250/hour × 6 hours = $1500/day  \n\nShe does makeup 4 times a week, so the weekly cost is:  \n$1500/day × 4 times = $6000/week  \n\nThe movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total cost is:  \n$6000/week × 5 weeks = $30000  \n\nThe makeup artist gives Jing a 10% discount, so the discount amount is:  \n$30000 × 10% = $3000  \n\nFinally, the amount Jing actually pays is:  \n$30000 - $3000 = $27000  \n\n27000\n\nCompare Answer  \nBoth the Chinese and English answers are the same, with both arriving at a final amount of 27000. The processes in both languages are consistent and correct.\n\nFinal Answer  \n27000",
