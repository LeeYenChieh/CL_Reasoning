The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes.\n\nThe probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:\n\\[\nP(>3) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row\n\nThe even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
