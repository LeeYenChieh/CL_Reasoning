Oakland would get the early lead in the first quarter as quarterback JaMarcus Russell completed a 20-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Chaz Schilens.

The Texans tried to rally in the fourth quarter as Brown nailed a 40-yard field goal, yet the Raiders' defense would shut down any possible attempt..\nAnswer questions based on the article \nQuestion: How many field goals did Kris Brown kick?\n\nChinese Answer\n首先，我们需要在文章中找到克里斯·布朗踢进的所有任意球。根据文章，第二节，休斯顿通过踢球手克里斯·布朗分别踢进了53码和24码的任意球将比分扳平。这说明他在第二节踢进了两次任意球。接着，在第四节，德州人队试图反扑，布朗踢进了一记40码的任意球。这里的“布朗”指的也是克里斯·布朗，因为他是德州人队的踢球手。综上，克里斯·布朗总共踢进了三次任意球。\n3\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, let's identify all the field goals made by Kris Brown in the article. In the second quarter, it says, \"Houston would tie the game in the second quarter with kicker Kris Brown getting a 53-yard and a 24-yard field goal.\" This means Kris Brown made two field goals in the second quarter. Then, in the fourth quarter, it says, \"the Texans tried to rally in the fourth quarter as Brown nailed a 40-yard field goal.\" Since Kris Brown is the Texans' kicker, this refers to him as well. Therefore, Kris Brown made a total of three field goals.\n3\n\nCompare Answer\nBoth the Chinese and English answers identified that Kris Brown kicked two field goals in the second quarter (53 yards and 24 yards) and one in the fourth quarter (40 yards), for a total of three field goals. The processes and answers are the same and correct.\n\nFinal Answer\n3",

In the last sentence, it says: \"but Dallas pulled away with Romo completing a 15-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton.\" This is the only mention of Crayton scoring a touchdown in the article, and there are no other touchdowns attributed to him. Therefore, Crayton had 1 touchdown in this game.\n1\n\nCompare Answer\nBoth the Chinese and English answers independently analyzed the article and concluded that Crayton had 1 touchdown.

Early in the third, Washington was able to equalize with John Potter making his first career field goal from 43 yards out.Both teams failed to score again, and the teams went into the final quarter tied at 17.

Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit. They did this, and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining. Washington got to midfield, but Griffin's hail mary pass was off the mark, and Washington lost once again. With the loss. Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game.

Early in the fourth quarter, he kicked another field goal from 28 yards to give Detroit a 20-17 lead. The question asks, \"How many yards did Akers lead with?\" Based on the context, this refers to the distance of the field goal that gave Detroit the lead. The first time Akers gave Detroit the lead was with the 32-yard field goal (17-14), and the second time was with the 28-yard field goal (20-17). Since the question asks for the yardage Akers led with, the answer should be the distance of the field goal that put Detroit ahead, which is 32 yards.\n\n32\n\nCompare Answer\nBoth the Chinese and English answers followed the same reasoning process and arrived at the same answer: 32. The process is correct in both cases, as the question refers to the field goal that gave Detroit the lead, which was the 32-yard field goal by Akers.\n\nFinal Answer\n32",

However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting.” 这句话的意思是，格里芬三世传球给外接手奥尔德里克·罗宾逊，达阵57码，但回放显示罗宾逊在倒地时没有控制好球，因此这个达阵被判为未完成传球。所以，罗宾逊实际上没有得分码数。答案是0。\n\n0\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, according to the problem, we need to find out how many yards Robinson scored. In the paragraph, it says: “On Washington's ensuing possession, it appeared as if Washington took the lead, as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57-yard score and an apparent 24-20 lead. However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting.” This means that although it looked like Robinson scored a 57-yard touchdown, the replay showed he did not complete the catch, so the play was ruled incomplete and he did not actually gain any yards on that play. Therefore, Robinson scored 0 yards.\n\n0\n\nCompare Answer\nBoth the Chinese and English answers correctly analyzed the paragraph and concluded that Robinson did not actually score any yards because the play was ruled incomplete.

After teams exchanged punts in the first, Washington struck first when Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was intercepted by Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall who returned the interception 9 yards for a 7-0 Washington lead.Detroit responded right away, however, as running back Joique Bell broke numerous tackles on his way to a 12-yard touchdown, evening the score at 7-7. The first quarter would conclude without any further scoring. Early in the second, Detroit finished off a drive with Stafford finding tight end Joseph Fauria for a 5-yard score to give Detroit the 14-7 lead. Later in the second, after a few missed opportunities by both teams, Redskins running back Alfred Morris took off for a 30-yard score, evening the score at 14-14 late in the second. Washington's much-maligned defense, however, could not hold it and Detroit retook the lead before halftime thanks to a David Akers 32-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 17-14 edge and halfway to its first win ever in Washington. Answer questions based on the article \nQuestion: How many points were scored in the first half?\n\nChinese Answer\n首先，我们需要找出上半场（即第一节和第二节）双方各自得了多少分，并计算总分。\n\n第一节：\n- 华盛顿：抄截回攻达阵，7分。\n- 底特律：跑卫贝尔12码达阵，7分。\n第一节结束，比分7-7。\n\n第二节：\n- 底特律：斯塔福德传球给福里亚，5码达阵，7分（加附加分）。\n- 华盛顿：莫里斯30码冲球达阵，7分（加附加分）。\n- 底特律：艾克斯32码射门，3分。\n\n第二节结束前，底特律以17-14领先。\n\n所以，上半场总得分为：\n华盛顿：7（第一节）+ 7（第二节）= 14分\n底特律：7（第一节）+ 7（第二节达阵）+ 3（射门）= 17分\n\n总分：14 + 17 = 31分\n\n31\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, let's identify all the points scored in the first half (first and second quarters).\n\nFirst quarter:\n- Washington: Interception return for a touchdown, 7 points.\n- Detroit: Joique Bell 12-yard rushing touchdown, 7 points.\nEnd of first quarter: 7-7.\n\nSecond quarter:\n- Detroit: Stafford to Fauria for a 5-yard touchdown, 7 points (including extra point).\n- Washington: Alfred Morris 30-yard rushing touchdown, 7 points (including extra point).\n- Detroit: David Akers 32-yard field goal, 3 points.\n\nBy halftime, Detroit led 17-14.\n\nSo, first half total points:\nWashington: 7 (first quarter) + 7 (second quarter) = 14\nDetroit: 7 (first quarter) + 7 (second quarter touchdown) + 3 (field goal) = 17\n\nTotal: 14 + 17 = 31\n\n31\n\nCompare Answer\n两个解答过程和答案完全一致，都是逐节统计得分，最后得出上半场总分为31分。两种语言的解答都正确。\n\nFinal Answer\n31",

The first quarter would conclude without any further scoring.” 这段话明确说明，第一节华盛顿首先通过抄截回攻达阵得分，底特律随后也通过跑卫达阵得分。之后第一节没有更多得分。所以，第一节一共得了2个达阵。\n\n2\n\nEnglish Answer\nFirst, let's review the paragraph for information about the first quarter. The text says: \"After teams exchanged punts in the first, Washington struck first when Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was intercepted by Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall who returned the interception 9 yards for a 7-0 Washington lead. Detroit responded right away, however, as running back Joique Bell broke numerous tackles on his way to a 12-yard touchdown, evening the score at 7-7. The first quarter would conclude without any further scoring.\" This clearly states that Washington scored a touchdown on an interception return, and Detroit scored a touchdown on a run. No further scoring occurred in the first quarter. Therefore, there were 2 touchdowns scored in the first quarter.\n\n2\n\nCompare Answer\nThe Chinese and English answers both independently analyzed the paragraph, identified the two touchdowns in the first quarter, and arrived at the same answer: 2. The processes and answers are the same and correct.\n\nFinal Answer\n2",
