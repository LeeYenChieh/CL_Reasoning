Additionally, running back Felix Jones had a 33-yard touchdown run, which is worth 6 points. After a touchdown, teams usually attempt an extra point kick, which is worth 1 point unless otherwise stated. Since the article does not mention a missed extra point, I will assume it was successful. Therefore, the total points scored by Dallas in the first quarter are: 3 (field goal) + 6 (touchdown) + 1 (extra point) = 10 points.\n\nEnglish Assistant B Answer\n10\n\n—————————————\n【比較答案】\n兩位助手的推理步驟和最終答案完全一致。兩者都根據文章內容，分別計算了射門得分（3分）、達陣得分（6分）以及附加分（1分），並假設附加分成功（因為文章未說明失敗）。最終都得出達拉斯牛仔隊在第一節得了10分。\n\n最終答案\n10",

The first time Akers put Detroit in the lead was with a 32-yard field goal (making it 17-14). The second time was a 28-yard field goal (making it 20-17).\n\nSince the question is phrased as \"how many yards did Akers lead with,\" it most likely refers to the first field goal that gave Detroit the lead, which was 32 yards.\n\nEnglish Assistant B Answer\n32\n\n—————————————\n【比較答案】\n兩位助手的推理都根據文章內容，找出了Akers踢進的讓底特律取得領先的射門碼數。兩邊都注意到Akers有兩次踢進讓球隊領先的射門（32碼和28碼），並根據問題語意選擇了第一次取得領先的32碼射門。推理過程和最終答案一致，無分歧。\n\n最終答案\n32",

    "output": "原始問題\nThere is a Paragraphs:  Coming off their road loss to Green Bay, Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007. After teams exchanged punts in the first, Washington struck first when Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was intercepted by Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall who returned the interception 9 yards for a 7-0 Washington lead.Detroit responded right away, however, as running back Joique Bell broke numerous tackles on his way to a 12-yard touchdown, evening the score at 7-7. The first quarter would conclude without any further scoring. Early in the second, Detroit finished off a drive with Stafford finding tight end Joseph Fauria for a 5-yard score to give Detroit the 14-7 lead. Later in the second, after a few missed opportunities by both teams, Redskins running back Alfred Morris took off for a 30-yard score, evening the score at 14-14 late in the second. Washington's much-maligned defense, however, could not hold it and Detroit retook the lead before halftime thanks to a David Akers 32-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 17-14 edge and halfway to its first win ever in Washington. Early in the third, Washington was able to equalize with John Potter making his first career field goal from 43 yards out.Both teams failed to score again, and the teams went into the final quarter tied at 17. Early in the fourth, Detroit took the lead again, this time by way of Akers hitting a 28-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 20-17 lead. On Washington's ensuing possession, it appeared as if Washington took the lead, as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57-yard score and an apparent 24-20 lead. However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting. Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit.
