    "question": "There is a Paragraphs:  Coming off their road loss to Green Bay, Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007. After teams exchanged punts in the first, Washington struck first when Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was intercepted by Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall who returned the interception 9 yards for a 7-0 Washington lead.Detroit responded right away, however, as running back Joique Bell broke numerous tackles on his way to a 12-yard touchdown, evening the score at 7-7. The first quarter would conclude without any further scoring. Early in the second, Detroit finished off a drive with Stafford finding tight end Joseph Fauria for a 5-yard score to give Detroit the 14-7 lead. Later in the second, after a few missed opportunities by both teams, Redskins running back Alfred Morris took off for a 30-yard score, evening the score at 14-14 late in the second. Washington's much-maligned defense, however, could not hold it and Detroit retook the lead before halftime thanks to a David Akers 32-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 17-14 edge and halfway to its first win ever in Washington.

They had never, prior to this day, lost to Detroit in Washington or Landover..\nAnswer questions based on the article \nQuestion: how many yards did Morris take off?\n\n中文問題\n以下是一段文字：在客場輸給綠灣之後，華盛頓回到主場，在聯邦快遞球場與底特律雄獅隊進行了一場對決，這是自2010年以來他們首次交鋒，但自2007年以來首次在華盛頓特區交鋒。在第一節雙方互踢互踢之後，華盛頓率先得分，雄獅隊四分衛馬修·斯塔福德被紅皮隊角衛德安傑洛·霍爾攔截，霍爾將球攔截後回跑9碼，華盛頓以7-0領先。然而，底特律立即做出回應，跑衛喬伊克·貝爾突破多個擒抱，推進12碼達陣，將比分扳成7-7。第一節結束時沒有再得分。第二節初，底特律完成了一次推進，斯塔福德找到近端鋒約瑟夫·福瑞亞，推進5碼得分，使底特律以14-7領先。第二節晚些時候，在雙方錯失幾次機會後，紅皮隊跑衛阿爾弗雷德·莫里斯衝刺30碼得分，在第二節末將比分扳成14-14。然而，華盛頓備受詬病的防守未能守住，底特律在上半場結束前憑藉大衛·阿克斯32碼的射門再次取得領先，使底特律以17-14領先，並完成在華盛頓的首勝。第三節初，華盛頓憑藉約翰·波特射入職業生涯首個43碼射門扳平比分。雙方未能再次得分，兩隊在最後一節以17平進入。第四節初，底特律再次取得領先，這次是阿克斯命中28碼射門，使底特律以20-17領先。在華盛頓隨後的一次進攻中，羅伯特·格里芬三世找到外接手奧爾德里克·羅賓遜，推進57碼得分，華盛頓似乎以24-20領先。然而，在視頻回放中顯示，羅賓遜在倒地時正在顛球，因此這次明顯的傳球被判為未完成，華盛頓未能再次得分，只能棄踢。底特律推進到球場，幾乎鎖定了勝局，斯塔福德在比賽還剩不到四分鐘時與超級巨星卡爾文·約翰遜連線。然而，華盛頓並沒有放棄，約翰·波特在21碼外連線，將比分追至27-20。然而，在未能搶回側踢後，華盛頓需要阻止底特律。他們做到了，並在比賽還剩不到50秒時拿回了球權。華盛頓推進到中場，但格里芬的萬福瑪利亞傳球偏離目標，華盛頓再次失利。隨著失利。華盛頓自2001年以來首次跌至0-3，並且連續第三次輸給底特律雄獅隊，自2008年以來他們就沒有擊敗過他們，當時他們甚至沒有贏得一場比賽。然而，華盛頓自1935年以來首次在主場輸給底特律，當時他們仍然是波士頓紅皮隊。在此之前，他們從未在華盛頓或蘭多弗輸給底特律。\n根據文章回答問題\n問題：莫里斯衝刺了多少碼？\n\n英文問題\nThere is a Paragraphs: Coming off their road loss to Green Bay, Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007.

Early in the third, Washington was able to equalize with John Potter making his first career field goal from 43 yards out.Both teams failed to score again, and the teams went into the final quarter tied at 17. Early in the fourth, Detroit took the lead again, this time by way of Akers hitting a 28-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 20-17 lead. On Washington's ensuing possession, it appeared as if Washington took the lead, as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57-yard score and an apparent 24-20 lead. However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting. Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit. They did this, and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining. Washington got to midfield, but Griffin's hail mary pass was off the mark, and Washington lost once again. With the loss. Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game. However, Washington lost to Detroit at home for the first time since 1935, when they were still the Boston Redskins.

Early in the second, Detroit finished off a drive with Stafford finding tight end Joseph Fauria for a 5-yard score to give Detroit the 14-7 lead. Later in the second, after a few missed opportunities by both teams, Redskins running back Alfred Morris took off for a 30-yard score, evening the score at 14-14 late in the second. Washington's much-maligned defense, however, could not hold it and Detroit retook the lead before halftime thanks to a David Akers 32-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 17-14 edge and halfway to its first win ever in Washington. Early in the third, Washington was able to equalize with John Potter making his first career field goal from 43 yards out.Both teams failed to score again, and the teams went into the final quarter tied at 17. Early in the fourth, Detroit took the lead again, this time by way of Akers hitting a 28-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 20-17 lead.

However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting. Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit. They did this, and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining. Washington got to midfield, but Griffin's hail mary pass was off the mark, and Washington lost once again. With the loss. Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game. However, Washington lost to Detroit at home for the first time since 1935, when they were still the Boston Redskins. They had never, prior to this day, lost to Detroit in Washington or Landover..\nAnswer questions based on the article \nQuestion: How many points did the Lions win by?\n\n中文問題\n以下是一段文章：在客場輸給綠灣之後，華盛頓回到主場FedExField與底特律雄獅隊進行了一場決鬥，這是自2010年以來他們首次交鋒，但自2007年以來首次在華盛頓特區交鋒。在第一節雙方互踢球後，華盛頓率先得分，當時雄獅隊四分衛馬修·斯塔福德被紅皮隊角衛德安傑洛·霍爾攔截，霍爾將球回攻9碼，華盛頓以7-0領先。然而，底特律立即做出回應，跑衛喬伊克·貝爾突破多次擒抱，以12碼達陣，將比分扳成7-7。第一節結束時沒有任何其他得分。第二節初，底特律完成了一次進攻，斯塔福德找到近端鋒約瑟夫·福里亞，以5碼的成績得分，使底特律以14-7領先。第二節晚些時候，在雙方錯失幾次機會後，紅皮隊跑衛阿爾弗雷德·莫里斯以30碼的成績得分，在第二節末將比分扳成14-14。然而，華盛頓備受詬病的防守無法守住，底特律在上半場結束前憑藉大衛·阿克斯的32碼射門重新取得領先，使底特律以17-14領先，並完成了在華盛頓的首場勝利的一半。第三節初，華盛頓憑藉約翰·波特命中了他職業生涯的第一次43碼射門扳平了比分。兩隊再次未能得分，兩隊在最後一節以17平進入。第四節初，底特律再次取得領先，這次是通過阿克斯命中28碼射門，使底特律以20-17領先。在華盛頓隨後的一次控球中，羅伯特·格里芬三世找到外接手奧爾德里克·羅賓遜，以57碼的成績得分，華盛頓以24-20領先。然而，通過視頻回放顯示，羅賓遜在倒地時正在顛球，因此這個明顯的傳球被判無效，華盛頓未能再次得分，只能棄踢。底特律推進到球場，幾乎鎖定了勝局，斯塔福德在比賽還剩不到四分鐘時與超級巨星卡爾文·約翰遜連接。然而，華盛頓沒有放棄，約翰·波特在21碼外命中，將比分追至27-20。然而，在未能恢復側踢後，華盛頓需要阻止底特律。他們做到了這一點，並在還剩不到50秒時重新拿回球。華盛頓到達中場，但格里芬的萬福瑪利亞傳球沒有命中，華盛頓再次失利。隨著失利，華盛頓自2001年以來首次以0-3開局，並且連續第三次輸給底特律雄獅隊，自2008年以來就沒有擊敗過他們，當時他們甚至沒有贏得一場比賽。然而，華盛頓自1935年以來首次在主場輸給底特律，當時他們仍然是波士頓紅皮隊。在此之前，他們從未在華盛頓或蘭多弗輸給底特律。\n根據文章回答問題\n問題：雄獅隊贏了多少分？\n\n英文問題\nThere is a Paragraphs: Coming off their road loss to Green Bay, Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007.

They had never, prior to this day, lost to Detroit in Washington or Landover..\nAnswer questions based on the article \nQuestion: How many points were scored in the first half?\n\n中文問題\n以下是一段文字：在客場輸給綠灣後，華盛頓回到主場聯邦快遞球場與底特律雄獅隊進行了一場對決，這是自 2010 年以來他們第一次交手，但自 2007 年以來第一次在華盛頓特區交手。在第一節雙方互踢定點球後，華盛頓率先發難，雄獅隊四分衛馬修·斯塔福德被紅皮隊角衛德安傑洛·霍爾攔截，並將球回傳 9 碼，華盛頓以 7-0 領先。然而，底特律立即做出回應，跑衛喬伊克·貝爾突破多次擒抱，以 12 碼達陣，將比分扳成 7-7。第一節結束時沒有再得分。第二節初，底特律完成了一次進攻，斯塔福德找到近端鋒約瑟夫·福里亞，以 5 碼的成績得分，讓底特律以 14-7 領先。第二節晚些時候，在雙方錯失幾次機會後，紅皮隊跑衛阿爾弗雷德·莫里斯起跑並以 30 碼的成績得分，在第二節末將比分扳成 14-14。然而，華盛頓備受詬病的防守未能守住，底特律在上半場結束前憑藉大衛·阿克斯的 32 碼射門再次取得領先，讓底特律以 17-14 領先，並完成了在華盛頓的第一次勝利的一半。第三節初，華盛頓憑藉約翰·波特射入他職業生涯中的第一個 43 碼射門扳平了比分。兩隊再次未能得分，兩隊在第四節以 17 分平局進入。第四節初，底特律再次取得領先，這次是通過阿克斯命中 28 碼射門，讓底特律以 20-17 領先。在華盛頓隨後的控球中，羅伯特·格里芬三世找到外接手奧爾德里克·羅賓遜，以 57 碼的成績得分，並以明顯的 24-20 領先，看起來華盛頓取得了領先。然而，在視頻回放中，顯示羅賓遜在倒地時正在顛球，因此表面上的傳球被判為不完整，華盛頓無法再次得分，只能棄踢。底特律向下推進，幾乎鎖定了勝局，斯塔福德與超級球星卡爾文·約翰遜在比賽還剩不到四分鐘時取得了聯繫。然而，華盛頓並沒有放棄，約翰·波特在 21 碼外命中，將比分追至 27-20。然而，在未能恢復側踢後，華盛頓需要阻止底特律。他們做到了，並在比賽還剩不到 50 秒時重新拿回了球。華盛頓到達中場，但格里芬的萬福瑪利亞傳球偏離了目標，華盛頓再次失利。隨著失利。華盛頓自 2001 年以來首次跌至 0-3，並且連續第三次輸給底特律雄獅隊，自 2008 年以來就沒有擊敗過他們，當時他們甚至沒有贏得一場比賽。然而，華盛頓自 1935 年以來首次在主場輸給底特律，當時他們仍然是波士頓紅皮隊。在此之前，他們從未在華盛頓或蘭多弗輸給底特律。\n根據文章回答問題\n問題：上半場得了多少分？\n\n英文問題\nThere is a Paragraphs: Coming off their road loss to Green Bay, Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007.

Later in the second, after a few missed opportunities by both teams, Redskins running back Alfred Morris took off for a 30-yard score, evening the score at 14-14 late in the second. Washington's much-maligned defense, however, could not hold it and Detroit retook the lead before halftime thanks to a David Akers 32-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 17-14 edge and halfway to its first win ever in Washington. Early in the third, Washington was able to equalize with John Potter making his first career field goal from 43 yards out.Both teams failed to score again, and the teams went into the final quarter tied at 17. Early in the fourth, Detroit took the lead again, this time by way of Akers hitting a 28-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 20-17 lead. On Washington's ensuing possession, it appeared as if Washington took the lead, as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57-yard score and an apparent 24-20 lead. However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting. Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit. They did this, and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining. Washington got to midfield, but Griffin's hail mary pass was off the mark, and Washington lost once again. With the loss. Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game.
