    "answer": "Janet\u2019s ducks lay a total of 16 eggs per day. Every morning, she eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends. Therefore, the total number of eggs she consumes daily (breakfast + muffins) is:\n\n\\[\n3 \\text{ eggs} + 4 \\text{ eggs} = 7 \\text{ eggs}\n\\]\n\nTo find out how many eggs she has left to sell at the farmers' market, we subtract the eggs she consumes from the total eggs laid:\n\n\\[\n16 \\text{ eggs} - 7 \\text{ eggs} = 9 \\text{ eggs}\n\\]\n\nJanet sells these 9 remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. The total revenue she makes from selling eggs is calculated by multiplying the number of eggs sold by the price per egg:\n\n\\[\n9 \\text{ eggs} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/egg} = 18 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the amount Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{18}\n\\]",

According to the problem, she spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking:\n   - Time spent running:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time running} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 6 = 2 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n   - Time spent walking:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time walking} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 6 = 4 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the distances**:  \n   Now, we can calculate the distance traveled during each activity using the formula \\( \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} \\).\n\n   - Distance running:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance running} = \\text{Running speed} \\times \\text{Time running} = 6 \\text{ mph} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 12 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n   - Distance walking:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance walking} = \\text{Walking speed} \\times \\text{Time walking} = 1.5 \\text{ mph} \\times 4 \\text{ hours} = 6 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total distance**:  \n   The total distance traveled by Dana is the sum of the distances from running and walking:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total distance} = \\text{Distance running} + \\text{Distance walking} = 12 \\text{ miles} + 6 \\text{ miles} = 18 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{18} \\text{ miles}\n\\]",

    "answer": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Suzy's iPhone age**: We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Suzy's iPhone age} = 1 \\text{ year}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Ben's iPhone age**: Ben's iPhone is said to be \"two times older\" than Suzy's iPhone. The phrase \"two times older\" typically means that we take Suzy's age and add it to double her age:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ben's iPhone age} = 1 + 2 \\cdot 1 = 1 + 2 = 3 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Brandon's iPhone age**: Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Brandon's iPhone age} = 4 \\cdot \\text{Ben's iPhone age} = 4 \\cdot 3 = 12 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Brandon's iPhone is \\( \\boxed{12} \\) years old.",

    "answer": "If Polly can throw the gold javelin a distance of 400 feet without the sapphire gemstone, then with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther:\n\n\\[\n400 \\, \\text{feet} \\times 3 = 1200 \\, \\text{feet}\n\\]\n\nSince the dragon breathes fire up to 1000 feet away, if Polly can throw the javelin a distance of 1200 feet with the gemstone, we need to calculate how far she can stand outside of the dragon's flame reach while still being able to hit the dragon.\n\nTo find this, we subtract the reach of the dragon's flames from the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone:\n\n\\[\n1200 \\, \\text{feet} - 1000 \\, \\text{feet} = 200 \\, \\text{feet}\n\\]\n\nThus, while holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly can stand **200 feet** outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.",

    "answer": "To find the number of grams of chips you can eat, we'll first determine how many calories you have left to consume and then use the nutritional information of the chips to find out how much you can eat.\n\n1. **Daily calorie target:** 2000 calories\n2. **Calories already consumed:** 1800 calories\n3. **Calories remaining:** 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories\n\nNow we need to find out how many servings of chips correspond to 200 calories. Since each serving has 250 calories, we can calculate the fraction of a serving that would equal 200 calories:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Fraction of a serving} = \\frac{200 \\text{ calories}}{250 \\text{ calories per serving}} = 0.8 \\text{ servings}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many grams are in 0.8 servings. We know that the entire bag has 5 servings and the total weight of the bag is 300 grams. Therefore, the weight of each serving is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Weight per serving} = \\frac{300 \\text{ grams}}{5 \\text{ servings}} = 60 \\text{ grams per serving}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the weight of 0.8 servings:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Weight for 0.8 servings} = 0.8 \\times 60 \\text{ grams} = 48 \\text{ grams}\n\\]\n\nThus, you can eat **48 grams** of chips.",

    "answer": "To calculate Charlie's net profit from selling 20 beeswax candles, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of supplies**:\n   - Each pound of beeswax makes 10 candles.\n   - Since he makes 20 candles, he needs \\(\\frac{20}{10} = 2\\) pounds of beeswax.\n   - The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.\n   - Therefore, for 2 pounds, the total cost is \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\) dollars.\n\n2. **Calculate the revenue from selling the candles**:\n   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.\n   - Therefore, selling 20 candles will generate \\(20 \\times 2 = 40\\) dollars in revenue.\n\n3. **Calculate the net profit**:\n   - Net profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost.\n   - Thus, net profit = Revenue - Cost = \\(40 - 20 = 20\\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 candles is **$20.00**.",

    "answer": "To find out how much John spent on ties, we first need to determine how many blue ties he bought and the cost of the red ties.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of blue ties:**\n   The cost of each blue tie is $40, and John spent $200 on blue ties. Therefore, the number of blue ties he bought is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of blue ties} = \\frac{\\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \\frac{200}{40} = 5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of red ties:**\n   According to the problem, John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he bought is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \\times 5 = 10\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of blue ties:**\n   We already know that he spent $200 on blue ties.\n\n4. **Calculate the cost of red ties:**\n   The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. The cost of a blue tie is $40. Therefore, the cost of a red tie is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of red tie} = \\text{Cost of blue tie} + 0.5 \\times \\text{Cost of blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \\times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the cost of all red ties:**\n   Now we can calculate how much he spent on the red ties:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total spent on red ties} = \\text{Number of red ties} \\times \\text{Cost of red tie} = 10 \\times 60 = 600\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total spent on all ties:**\n   Finally, to find the total amount spent on all ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total spent on all ties} = \\text{Total spent on blue ties} + \\text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800\n   \\]\n\nThus, John spent a total of \\(\\boxed{800}\\) dollars on ties.",
