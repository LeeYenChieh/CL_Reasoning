    "output": "Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. Therefore, the total number of eggs she consumes or uses each day is:\n\n3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for muffins) = 7 eggs\n\nThe number of eggs remaining to sell at the farmers' market is:\n\n16 (total eggs) - 7 (eggs consumed) = 9 eggs\n\nJanet sells these 9 eggs at $2 each. Therefore, the total amount of money she makes from selling the eggs is:\n\n9 eggs \u00d7 $2/egg = $18\n\nSo, the total amount Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is:\n\n18",
